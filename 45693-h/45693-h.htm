<h3>CHAPTER CI.</h3>

<p>Adieu, thou beautiful land! Canaan
of the exiles, and Ararat to many a
shattered ark! Fair cradle of a race
for whom the unbounded heritage of
a future, that no sage can conjecture,
no prophet divine, lies afar in the
golden promise-light of Time!&mdash;destined,
perchance, from the sins and
sorrows of a civilisation struggling
with its own elements of decay, to
renew the youth of the world, and
transmit the great soul of England
through the cycles of Infinite Change.
All climates that can best ripen the
products of earth, or form into various
character and temper the different
families of man, "rain influences" from
the heaven, that smiles so benignly
on those who had once shrunk, ragged,
from the wind, or scowled on the
thankless sun. Here, the hardy air
of the chill Mother Isle, there the mild
warmth of Italian autumns, or the
breathless glow of the tropics. And
with the beams of every climate, glides
subtle <span class="smcap">Hope</span>. Of her there, it may
be said as of Light itself, in those exquisite
lines of a neglected poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through the soft ways of heaven, and air, and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which open all their pores to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a clear river thou dost glide&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the world's bravery, that delights our eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but thy several liveries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou the rich dye on them bestowest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy nimble pencil paints the landscape as thou goest."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Adieu, my kind nurse and sweet
foster-mother!&mdash;a long and a last
adieu! Never had I left thee but for
that louder voice of Nature which calls
the child to the parent, and woos us
from the labours we love the best by
the chime in the Sabbath-bells of Home.</p>

<p>No one can tell how dear the memory
of that wild Bush-life becomes to him
who has tried it with a <i>fitting spirit</i>.
How often it haunts him in the commonplace
of more civilised scenes!
Its dangers, its risks, its sense of
animal health, its bursts of adventure,
its intervals of careless repose&mdash;the
fierce gallop through a very sea of
wide rolling plains&mdash;the still saunter,
at night, through woods never changing
their leaves&mdash;with the moon, clear
as sunshine, stealing slant through
their clusters of flowers. With what
an effort we reconcile ourselves to the
trite cares and vexed pleasures, "the
quotidian ague of frigid impertinences,"
to which we return! How strong and
black stands my pencil-mark in this
passage of the poet from which I have
just quoted before!&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are here among the vast and
noble scenes of Nature&mdash;we are there
among the pitiful shifts of policy; we
walk here, in the light and open ways
of the Divine Bounty&mdash;we grope there,
in the dark and confused labyrinth of
human malice."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But I weary you, reader. The New
World vanishes&mdash;now a line&mdash;now a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>speck: let us turn away, with the face
to the Old.</p>

<p>Among my fellow-passengers, how
many there are returning home disgusted,
disappointed, impoverished,
ruined, throwing themselves again on
those unsuspecting poor friends, who
thought they had done with the luckless
good-for-naughts for ever. For
don't let me deceive thee, reader, into
supposing that every adventurer to
Australia has the luck of Pisistratus.
Indeed, though the poor labourer, and
especially the poor operative from
London and the great trading towns,
(who has generally more of the quick
knack of learning&mdash;the <i>adaptable faculty</i>&mdash;required
in a new colony, than
the simple agricultural labourer,) are
pretty sure to succeed, the class to
which I belong is one in which failures
are numerous, and success the exception&mdash;I
mean young men with
scholastic education and the habits of
gentlemen&mdash;with small capitals and
sanguine hopes. But this, in ninety-nine
times out of a hundred, is not the
fault of the colony, but of the emigrants.
It requires, not so much
intellect as a peculiar turn of intellect,
and a fortunate combination of physical
qualities, easy temper, and quick
mother-wit, to make a small capitalist
a prosperous Bushman.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And if you
could see the sharks that swim round
a man just dropped at Adelaide or
Sydney, with one or two thousand
pounds in his pocket! Hurry out of
the towns as fast as you can, my young
emigrant; turn a deaf ear, for the
present at least, to all jobbers and
speculators; make friends with some
practised old Bushman; spend several
months at his station before you hazard
your capital; take with you a temper
to bear everything and sigh for nothing;
put your whole heart in what
you are about; never call upon Hercules
when your cart sticks in the rut,
and, whether you feed sheep or breed
cattle, your success is but a question
of time.</p>

<p>But, whatever I owed to nature, I
owed also something to fortune. I
bought my sheep at little more than
7s. each. When I left, none were
worth less than 15s., and the fat sheep
were worth &pound;1.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I had an excellent
shepherd, and my whole care, night
and day, was the improvement of the
flock. I was fortunate, too, in entering
Australia before the system miscalled
"The Wakefield"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had diminished
the supply of labour and raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>the price of land. When the change
came, (like most of those with large
allotments and surplus capital,) it
greatly increased the value of my own
property, though at the cost of a terrible
blow on the general interests of
the colony. I was lucky, too, in the
additional venture of a cattle station,
and in the breed of horses and herds,
which, in the five years devoted to
that branch establishment, trebled the
sum invested therein, exclusive of the
advantageous sale of the station.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I
was lucky, also, as I have stated, in
the purchase and resale of lands, at
Uncle Jack's recommendation. And,
lastly, I left in time, and escaped a
very disastrous crisis in colonial affairs,
which I take the liberty of
attributing entirely to the mischievous
crotchets of theorists at home, who
want to set all clocks by Greenwich
time, forgetting that it is morning
in one part of the world at the time
they are tolling the curfew in the
other.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER CII.</h3>

<p>London once more! How strange,
lone, and savage I feel in the streets.
I am ashamed to have so much health
and strength, when I look at those
slim forms, stooping backs, and pale
faces. I pick my way through the
crowd with the merciful timidity of a
good-natured giant. I am afraid of
jostling against a man for fear the collision
should kill him. I get out of
the way of a thread-paper clerk, and
'tis a wonder I am not run over by the
omnibuses;&mdash;I feel as if I could run
over them! I perceive, too, that there
is something outlandish, peregrinate,
and lawless about me. Beau Brummell
would certainly have denied me
all pretension to the simple air of a
gentleman, for every third passenger
turns back to look at me. I retreat
to my hotel&mdash;send for bootmaker,
hatter, tailor, and haircutter. I
humanise myself from head to foot.
Even Ulysses is obliged to have recourse
to the arts of Minerva, and, to
speak unmetaphorically, "smarten
himself up," before the faithful Penelope
condescends to acknowledge him.
The artificers promise all despatch.
Meanwhile I hasten to re-make acquaintance
with my mother country
over files of the <i>Times</i>, <i>Post</i>, <i>Chronicle</i>,
and <i>Herald</i>. Nothing comes amiss to
me, but articles on Australia; from
those I turn aside with the true
pshaw-supercilious of your practical
man.</p>

<p>No more are leaders filled with
praise and blame of Trevanion.
"Percy's spur is cold." Lord Ulverstone
figures only in the <i>Court Circular</i>,
or "<i>Fashionable Movements</i>." Lord
Ulverstone entertains a royal duke at
dinner, or dines in turn with a royal
duke, or has come to town, or gone
out of it. At most, (faint Platonic
reminiscence of the former life,) Lord
Ulverstone says in the House of
Lords a few words on some question,
not a party one; and on which (though
affecting perhaps the interests of some
few thousands, or millions, as the case
may be) men speak without "hears,"
and are inaudible in the gallery; or
Lord Ulverstone takes the chair at an
agricultural meeting, or returns thanks
when his health is drank at a dinner
at Guildhall. But the daughter rises
as the father sets, though over a very
different kind of world.</p>

<p>"First ball of the season at Castleton
House!" Long descriptions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>the rooms and the company; above
all, of the hostess. Lines on the
Marchioness of Castleton's picture in
the "Book of Beauty," by the Hon.
Fitzroy Fiddledum, beginning with,
"Art thou an angel from," &amp;c&mdash;a
paragraph that pleased me more on
"Lady Castleton's Infant School, at
Raby Park;" then again&mdash;"Lady
Castleton, the new patroness at
Almacks;" a criticism more rapturous
than ever gladdened living poet, on
Lady Castleton's superb diamond
stomacher, just re-set by Storr and
Mortimer; Westmacott's bust of Lady
Castleton; Landseer's picture of Lady
Castleton and her children, in the
costume of the olden time. Not a
month in that long file of the <i>Morning
Post</i> but what Lady Castleton shone
forth from the rest of womankind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"&mdash;&mdash;Velut inter ignes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luna minores."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The blood mounted to my cheek.
Was it to this splendid constellation
in the patrician heaven that my obscure,
portionless youth had dared to
lift its presumptuous eyes? But
what is this? "Indian intelligence&mdash;Skilful
Retreat of the Sepoys, under
Captain de Caxton!" A captain
already&mdash;what is the date of the newspaper?
Three months ago. The leading
article quotes the name with high
praise. Is there no leaven of envy
amidst the joy at my heart? How
obscure has been my career&mdash;how
laurel-less my poor battle with adverse
fortune! Fie, Pisistratus! I am
ashamed of thee. Has this accursed
Old World, with its feverish rivalries,
diseased thee already? Get thee
home, quick, to the arms of thy
mother, the embrace of thy father&mdash;hear
Roland's low blessing, that thou
hast helped to minister to the very
fame of that son. If thou wilt have
ambition, take it, not soiled and foul
with the mire of London. Let it
spring fresh and hardy in the calm
air of wisdom; and fed, as with dews,
by the loving charities of Home.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER CIII.</h3>

<p>It was at sunset that I stole through
the ruined courtyard, having left my
chaise at the foot of the hill below.
Though they whom I came to seek
knew that I had arrived in England,
they did not, from my letter, expect
me till the next day. I had stolen a
march upon them; and now, in spite
of all the impatience which had urged
me thither, I was afraid to enter&mdash;afraid
to see the change more than
ten years had made in those forms,
for which, in my memory, time had
stood still. And Roland had, even
when we parted, grown old before his
time. Then, my father was in the
meridian of life, now he had approached
to the decline. And my mother,
whom I remembered so fair, as if the
freshness of her own heart had preserved
the soft bloom to the cheek&mdash;I
could not bear to think that she
was no longer young. Blanche, too,
whom I had left a child&mdash;Blanche,
my constant correspondent during
those long years of exile, in letters
crossed and re-crossed, with all the
small details that make the eloquence
of letter writing, so that in those epistles
I had seen her mind gradually grow
up in harmony with the very characters&mdash;at
first vague and infantine&mdash;then
somewhat stiff with the first
graces of running hand, then dashing
off, free and facile; and, for the last
year before I left, so formed, yet so
airy&mdash;so regular, yet so unconscious
of effort&mdash;though, in truth, as the
caligraphy had become thus matured,
I had been half vexed and half pleased
to perceive a certain reserve creeping
over the style&mdash;wishes for my return
less expressed from herself than as
messages from others; words of the
old childlike familiarity repressed;
and "Dearest Sisty" abandoned for
the cold form of "Dear Cousin."
Those letters, coming to me in a spot
where maiden and love had been as
myths of the bygone, phantasms and
<i>eidola</i>, only vouchsafed to the visions of
fancy, had, by little and little, crept
into secret corners of my heart; and
out of the wrecks of a former romance,
solitude and reverie had gone far to
build up the fairy domes of a romance
yet to come. My mother's letters
had never omitted to make mention
of Blanche&mdash;of her forethought and
tender activity, of her warm heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
and sweet temper&mdash;and, in many a
little home picture, presented her
image where I would fain have placed
it, not "crystal-seeing," but joining
my mother in charitable visits to
the village, instructing the young,
and tending on the old, or teaching
herself to illuminate, from an old
missal in my father's collection, that
she might surprise my uncle with a
new genealogical table, with all shields
and quarterings, blazoned <i>or</i>, <i>sable</i>,
and <i>argent</i>; or flitting round my father
where he sat, and watching when he
looked round for some book he was
too lazy to rise for. Blanche had
made a new catalogue and got it by
heart, and knew at once from what
corner of the Heraclea to summon
the ghost. On all these little traits
had my mother been eulogistically
minute; but somehow or other she
had never said, at least for the last
two years, whether Blanche was pretty
or plain. That was a sad omission.
I had longed just to ask that simple
question, or to imply it delicately and
diplomatically; but, I know not why,
I never dared&mdash;for Blanche would
have been sure to have read the letter&mdash;and
what business was it of mine?
And, if she <i>was</i> ugly, what question
more awkward both to put and to answer?
Now, in childhood, Blanche
had just one of those faces that might
become very lovely in youth, and
would yet quite justify the suspicion
that it might become gryphonesque,
witch-like, and grim. Yes, Blanche,
it is perfectly true! If those large,
serious black eyes took a fierce light,
instead of a tender&mdash;if that nose, which
seemed then undecided whether to
be straight or to be aquiline, arched
off in the latter direction, and assumed
the martial, Roman, and imperative
character of Roland's manly proboscis&mdash;if
that face, in childhood too thin,
left the blushes of youth to take refuge
on two salient peaks by the temples
(Cumberland air, too, is famous for
the growth of the cheek-bone!)&mdash;if all
that should happen, and it very well
might, then, O Blanche, I wish thou
hadst never written me those letters;
and I might have done wiser things
than steel my heart so obdurately to
pretty Ellen Bolding's blue eyes and
silk shoes. Now, combining together
all these doubts and apprehensions,
wonder not, O reader, why I stole so
stealthily through the ruined courtyard,
crept round to the other side of
the tower, gazed wistfully on the sun
setting slant on the high casements
of the hall, (too high, alas, to look
within,) and shrunk yet to enter;&mdash;doing
battle, as it were, with my
heart.</p>

<p>Steps!&mdash;one's sense of hearing
grows so quick in the Bushland!&mdash;steps,
though as light as ever brushed
the dew from the harebell! I crept
under the shadow of the huge buttress
mantled with ivy. A form
comes from the little door at an
angle in the ruins&mdash;a woman's form.
Is it my mother?&mdash;it is too tall, and
the step is more bounding. It winds
round the building, it turns to look
back, and a sweet voice&mdash;a voice
strange, yet familiar&mdash;calls, tender,
but chiding, to a truant that lags
behind. Poor Juba! he is trailing
his long ears on the ground: he is
evidently much disturbed in his
mind; now he stands still, his nose
in the air. Poor Juba! I left thee
so slim and so nimble&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy form, that was fashioned as light as a fay's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has assumed a proportion more round."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Years have sobered thee strangely,
and made thee obese and Primmins-like.
They have taken too good care
of thy creature comforts, O sensual
Mauritanian! still, in that mystic
intelligence we call instinct, thou art
chasing something that years have
not swept from thy memory. Thou
art deaf to thy lady's voice, however
tender and chiding. That's right,&mdash;come
near&mdash;nearer&mdash;my cousin
Blanche; let me have a fair look at
thee. Plague take the dog! he flies
off from her: he has found the scent&mdash;he
is making up to the buttress!
Now&mdash;pounce&mdash;he is caught! whining
ungallant discontent. Shall I not yet
see the face? it is buried in Juba's
black curls. Kisses too! Wicked
Blanche, to waste on a dumb animal
what, I heartily hope, many a good
Christian would be exceedingly glad
of! Juba struggles in vain, and is
borne off. I don't think that those
eyes can have taken the fierce turn,
and Roland's eagle nose can never
go with that voice which has the coo
of the dove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>I leave my hiding-place, and steal
after the Voice, and its owner. Where
can she be going? Not far. She
springs up the hill whereon the lords
of the castle once administered justice&mdash;that
hill which commands the land
far and wide, and from which can be
last caught the glimpse of the westering
sun. How gracefully still is
that attitude of wistful repose! Into
what delicate curves do form and
drapery harmoniously flow! How
softly distinct stands the lithe image
against the purple hues of the sky!
Then again comes the sweet voice,
gay and carolling as a bird's&mdash;now in
snatches of song, now in playful appeals
to that dull four-footed friend.
She is telling him something that
must make the black ears stand on
end, for I just catch the words, "He
is coming," and "home!"</p>

<p>I cannot see the sun set where I
lurk in my ambush, amidst the brake
and the ruins; but I <i>feel</i> that the orb
has passed from the landscape, in the
fresher air of the twilight, in the
deeper silence of eve. Lo! Hesper
comes forth: at his signal, star after
star, come the hosts&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ch'eran con lui, quando l'amor divino,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mosse da prim&agrave; quelle cose belle!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the sweet voice is hushed.</p>

<p>Then slowly the watcher descends
the hill on the opposite side&mdash;the
form escapes from my view. What
charm has gone from the twilight?
See, again, where the step steals
through the ruins and along the desolate
court. Ah! deep and true heart,
do I divine the remembrance that
leads thee? I pass through the wicket,
down the dell, skirt the laurels,
and behold the face, looking up to
the stars&mdash;the face which had nestled
to my breast in the sorrow of parting,
years, long years ago: on the grave
where we had sat, I the boy, thou
the infant&mdash;there, O Blanche! is thy
fair face&mdash;(fairer than the fondest
dream that had gladdened my exile)&mdash;vouchsafed
to my gaze!</p>

<p>"Blanche, my cousin!&mdash;again,
again&mdash;soul with soul, amidst the
dead! Look up, Blanche; it is I."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER CIV.</h3>

<p>"Go in first, and prepare them,
dear Blanche: I will wait by the door.
Leave it ajar, that I may see them."</p>

<p>Roland is leaning against the wall&mdash;old
armour suspended over the gray
head of the soldier. It is but a glance
that I gave to the dark cheek and
high brow: no change there for the
worse&mdash;no new sign of decay. Rather,
if anything, Roland seems younger
than when I left. Calm is the brow&mdash;no
shame on it now, Roland; and
the lips, once so compressed, smile
with ease&mdash;no struggle now, Roland,
"not to complain." A glance shows
me all this.</p>

<p>"Pap&aelig;!" says my father, and I hear
the fall of a book, "I can't read a line.
He is coming to-morrow!&mdash;to-morrow!
If we lived to the age of Methusalem,
Kitty, we could never
reconcile philosophy and man; that
is, if the poor man's to be plagued
with a good affectionate son!"</p>

<p>And my father gets up and walks
to and fro. One minute more, father&mdash;one
minute more&mdash;and I am on thy
breast! Time, too, has dealt gently
with thee, as he doth with those for
whom the wild passions and keen
cares of the world never sharpen his
scythe. The broad front looks more
broad, for the locks are more scanty
and thin; but still not a furrow!</p>

<p>Whence comes that short sigh?</p>

<p>"What is really the time, Blanche?
Did you look at the turret clock?
Well, just go and look again."</p>

<p>"Kitty," quoth my father, "you
have not only asked what time it is
thrice within the last ten minutes, but
you have got my watch, and Roland's
great chronometer, and the Dutch
clock out of the kitchen, all before
you, and they all concur in the same
tale&mdash;to-day is not to-morrow."</p>

<p>"They are all wrong, I know," said
my mother, with mild firmness; "and
they've never gone right since he left."</p>

<p>Now out comes a letter&mdash;for I hear
the rustle&mdash;and then a step glides towards
the lamp; and the dear, gentle,
womanly face&mdash;fair still, fair ever for
me&mdash;fair as when it bent over my
pillow, in childhood's first sickness, or
when we threw flowers at each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
on the lawn at sunny noon! And
now Blanche is whispering; and now
the flutter, the start, the cry&mdash;"It is
true! it is true! Your arms, mother.
Close, close round my neck, as in the
old time. Father! Roland, too! Oh
joy! joy! joy! home again&mdash;home
till death!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER CV.</h3>

<p>From a dream of the Bushland,
howling dingoes,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the war-whoop
of the wild men, I wake and see the
sun shining in through the jasmine
that Blanche herself has had trained
round the window&mdash;old school-books,
neatly ranged round the wall&mdash;fishing
rods, cricket-bats, foils, and the old-fashioned
gun,&mdash;and my mother seated
by the bedside&mdash;and Juba whining
and scratching to get up. Had I
taken thy murmured blessing, my
mother, for the whoop of the blacks,
and Juba's low whine for the howl of
the dingoes?</p>

<p>Then what days of calm exquisite
delight!&mdash;the interchange of heart with
heart; what walks with Roland, and
tales of him once our shame, now our
pride; and the art with which the old
man would lead those walks round by
the village, that some favourite gossips
might stop and ask, "What news of
his brave young honour?"</p>

<p>I strive to engage my uncle in my
projects for the repair of the ruins&mdash;for
the culture of those wide bogs and
moorlands: why is it that he turns
away, and looks down embarrassed?
Ah, I guess!&mdash;his true heir now is
restored to him. He cannot consent
that I should invest this dross, for
which (the Great Book once published)
I have no other use, in the house and
the lands that will pass to his son.
Neither would he suffer me so to invest
even his son's fortune, the bulk of
which I still hold in trust for that son.
True, in his career, my cousin may
require to have his money always
forthcoming. But I, who have no
career,&mdash;pooh! these scruples will rob
me of half the pleasure my years of toil
were to purchase. I must contrive it
somehow or other: what if he would
let me house and moorland on a long
improving lease? Then, for the rest,
there is a pretty little property to be
sold close by, on which I can retire
when my cousin, as heir of the family,
comes, perhaps with a wife, to reside
at the Tower. I must consider of all
this, and talk it over with Bolt when
my mind is at leisure from happiness
to turn to such matters; meanwhile
I fall back on my favourite proverb,&mdash;"<i>Where
there's a will there's a way</i>."</p>

<p>What smiles and tears, and laughter
and careless prattle with my mother,
and roundabout questions from her, to
know if I had never lost my heart in the
Bush; and evasive answers from me,
to punish her for not letting out that
Blanche was so charming. "I fancied
Blanche had grown the image of her
father, who has a fine martial head
certainly, but not seen to advantage
in petticoats! How could you be so
silent with a theme so attractive?"</p>

<p>"Blanche made me promise."</p>

<p>Why? I wonder. Therewith I fell
musing.</p>

<p>What quiet delicious hours are
spent with my father in his study, or
by the pond, where he still feeds the
carps, that have grown into Ceprinidian
leviathans. The duck, alas!
has departed this life&mdash;the only victim
that the Grim King has carried off;
so I mourn, but am resigned to that
lenient composition of the great tribute
to Nature. I am sorry to say the
Great Book has advanced but slowly&mdash;by
no means yet fit for publication,
for it is resolved that it shall not come
out as first proposed, a part at a time,
but <i>totus, teres, atque rotundus</i>. The
matter has spread beyond its original
compass; no less than five volumes&mdash;and
those of the amplest&mdash;will contain
the History of Human Error. However,
we are far in the fourth, and one
must not hurry Minerva.</p>

<p>My father is enchanted with Uncle
Jack's "noble conduct," as he calls it;
but he scolds me for taking the money,
and doubts as to the propriety of returning
it. In these matters my father
is quite as Quixotical as Roland. I
am forced to call in my mother as
umpire between us, and she settles the
matter at once by an appeal to feeling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
"Ah, Austin! do you not humble me,
if you are too proud to accept what is
due to you from my brother."</p>

<p>"<i>Velit, nolit, quod amica</i>," answered
my father, taking off and rubbing
his spectacles&mdash;"which means,
Kitty, that when a man's married he
has no will of his own. To think,"
added Mr Caxton, musingly, "that
in this world one cannot be sure of the
simplest mathematical definition! You
see, Pisistratus, that the angles of a
triangle so decidedly scalene as your
Uncle Jack's, may be equal to the
angles of a right-angled triangle after
all!"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The long privation of books has
quite restored all my appetite for them.
How much I have to pick up!&mdash;what
a compendious scheme of reading I
and my father chalk out. I see
enough to fill up all the leisure of
life. But, somehow or other, Greek
and Latin stand still: nothing charms
me like Italian. Blanche and I are
reading Metastasio, to the great indignation
of my father, who calls it
"rubbish," and wants to substitute
Dante. I have no associations at present
with the souls</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Che son contenti<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nel fuoco;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am already one of the "<i>beate
gente</i>." Yet, in spite of Metastasio,
Blanche and I are not so intimate as
cousins ought to be. If we are by
accident alone, I become as silent as
a Turk, as formal as Sir Charles
Grandison. I caught myself calling
her <i>Miss</i> Blanche the other day.</p>

<p>I must not forget thee, honest
Squills!&mdash;nor thy delight at my health
and success; nor thy exclamation of
pride, (one hand on my pulse and the
other griping hard the "ball" of my
arm,) "It all comes of my citrate of
iron; nothing like it for children; it
has an effect on the cerebral developments
of hope and combativeness."
Nor can I wholly omit mention of poor
Mrs Primmins, who still calls me
"Master Sisty," and is breaking her
heart that I will not wear the new
flannel waistcoats she had such pleasure
in making&mdash;"Young gentlemen
just growing up are so apt to go off in a
galloping 'sumption!" "She knew just
such another as Master Sisty, when
she lived at Torquay, who wasted
away, and went out like a <i>snuff</i>, all
because he would not wear flannel
waistcoats." Therewith my mother
looks grave, and says, "One can't
take too much precaution."</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole neighbourhood
is thrown into commotion. Trevanion&mdash;I
beg his pardon, Lord Ulverstone&mdash;is
coming to settle for good at
Compton. Fifty hands are employed,
daily in putting the grounds into hasty
order. Fourgons, and waggons, and
vans have disgorged all the necessaries
a great man requires, where he means
to eat, drink, and sleep&mdash;books, wines,
pictures, furniture. I recognise my
old patron still. He is in earnest,
whatever he does. I meet my friend,
his steward, who tells me that Lord
Ulverstone finds his favourite seat,
near London, too exposed to interruption;
and, moreover, that as he has
there completed all improvements that
wealth and energy can effect, he has
less occupation for agricultural pursuits,
to which he has grown more
and more partial, than on the wide
and princely domain which has hitherto
wanted the master's eye. "He is
a bra' farmer, I know," quoth the
steward, "so far as the theory goes
but I don't think we in the north want
great lords to teach us how to follow
the pleugh." The steward's sense of
dignity is hurt; but he is an honest
fellow, and really glad to see the
family come to settle in the old place.</p>

<p>They have arrived, and with them
the Castletons, and a whole <i>posse
comitatus</i> of guests. The County
Paper is full of fine names.</p>

<p>"What on earth did Lord Ulverstone,
mean by pretending to get out of the
way of troublesome visitors?"</p>

<p>"My dear Pisistratus," answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>my father to that exclamation, "it
is not the visitors who come, but the
visitors who stay away, that most
trouble the repose of a retired minister.
In all the procession, he sees but the
images of Brutus and Cassius&mdash;that
are <i>not</i> there! And depend on it, also,
a retirement so near London did not
make noise enough. You see, a retiring
statesman is like that fine carp&mdash;the
farther he leaps from the water,
the greater splash he makes in falling
into the weeds! But," added Mr
Caxton, in a repentant tone, "this
jesting does not become us; and, if I
indulged it, it is only because I am
heartily glad that Trevanion is likely
now to find out his true vocation.
And as soon as the fine people he
brings with him have left him alone
in his library, I trust he will settle to
that vocation, and be happier than he
has been yet."</p>

<p>"And that vocation, sir, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Metaphysics!" said my father.
"He will be quite at home in puzzling
over Berkeley, and considering whether
the Speaker's chair, and the official
red boxes, were really things whose
ideas of figure, extension, and hardness,
were all in the mind. It will
be a great consolation to him to agree,
with Berkeley, and to find that he has
only been baffled by immaterial phantasma!"</p>

<p>My father was quite right. The
repining, subtle, truth-weighing Trevanion,
plagued by his conscience into
seeing all sides of a question, (for
the least question has more than two
sides, and is hexagonal at least,) was
much more fitted to discover the origin
of ideas than to convince Cabinets
and Nations that two and two make
four&mdash;a proposition on which he himself
would have agreed with Abraham
Tucker, where that most ingenious
and suggestive of all English metaphysicians
observes, "Well persuaded
as I am that two and two make four,
if I were to meet with a person of
credit, candour, and understanding,
who should sincerely call it in question,
I would give him a hearing; for I am
not more certain of that than of the
whole being greater than a part. And
yet I could myself suggest <i>some considerations
that might seem to controvert
this point</i>."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I can so well imagine
Trevanion listening to "some person
of credit, candour, and understanding,"
in disproof of that vulgar proposition
that twice two make four! But the
news of this arrival, including that of
Lady Castleton, disturbed me greatly,
and I took to long wanderings alone.
In one of these rambles, they all called
at the Tower&mdash;Lord and Lady Ulverstone,
the Castletons, and their children.
I escaped the visit; and on
my return home, there was a certain
delicacy respecting old associations,
that restrained much talk before me
on so momentous an event. Roland,
like me, had kept out of the way.
Blanche, poor child, ignorant of the
antecedents, was the most communicative.
And the especial theme she
selected&mdash;was the grace and beauty of
Lady Castleton!</p>

<p>A pressing invitation to spend some
days at the castle had been cordially
given to all. It was accepted
only by myself: I wrote word
that I would come.</p>

<p>Yes; I longed to prove the strength
of my own self-conquest, and accurately
test the nature of the feelings
that had disturbed me. That any sentiment
which could be called love
remained for Lady Castleton, the
wife of another, and that other a man
with so many claims on my affection
as her lord, I held as a moral impossibility.
But, with all those lively
impressions of early youth still engraved
on my heart&mdash;impressions
of the image of Fanny Trevanion,
as the fairest and brightest of human
beings&mdash;could I feel free to love
again? Could I seek to woo, and
rivet to myself for ever, the entire
and virgin affections of another, while
there was a possibility that I might
compare and regret? No; either
I must feel that, if Fanny were
again single&mdash;could be mine without
obstacle, human or divine&mdash;she
had ceased to be the one I would
single out of the world; or, though
regarding love as the dead, I would
be faithful to its memory and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>ashes. My mother sighed, and
looked fluttered and uneasy all the
morning of the day on which I was
to repair to Compton. She even
seemed cross, for about the third time
in her life, and paid no compliment
to Mr Stultz, when my shooting-jacket
was exchanged for a black
frock, which that artist had pronounced
to be "splendid;" neither
did she honour me with any of those
little attentions to the contents of my
portmanteau, and the perfect "getting
up" of my white waistcoats and
cravats, which made her natural
instincts on such memorable occasions.
There was also a sort of querulous
pitying tenderness in her tone
when she spoke to Blanche, which
was quite pathetic; though, fortunately,
its cause remained dark
and impenetrable to the innocent
comprehension of one who could not
see where the past filled the urns of
the future, at the fountain of life.
My father understood me better&mdash;shook
me by the hand, as I got into
the chaise, and muttered, out of
Seneca&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Non tanquam transfuga, sed tanquam explorator!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Not to desert, but examine.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Quite right.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER CVI.</h3>

<p>Agreeably to the usual custom in
great houses, as soon as I arrived at
Compton I was conducted to my
room, to adjust my toilet, or compose
my spirits by solitude:&mdash;it
wanted an hour to dinner. I had
not, however, been thus left ten
minutes, before the door opened, and
Trevanion himself, (as I would fain
still call him) stood before me. Most
cordial were his greeting and welcome;
and, seating himself by my
side, he continued to converse, in his
peculiar way&mdash;bluntly eloquent, and
carelessly learned&mdash;till the half hour
bell rang. He talked on Australia,
the Wakefield system&mdash;cattle&mdash;books,
his trouble in arranging his library&mdash;his
schemes for improving his property,
and embellishing his grounds&mdash;his
delight to find my father look so
well&mdash;his determination to see a great
deal of him, whether his old college
friend would or no. He talked, in
short, of everything except politics,
and his own past career&mdash;showing only
his soreness in that silence. But (independently
of the mere work of time,)
he looked yet more worn and jaded in
his leisure than he had done in the full
tide of business; and his former abrupt
quickness of manner now seemed
to partake of feverish excitement. I
hoped that my father <i>would</i> see much
of him, for I felt that the weary mind
wanted soothing.</p>

<p>Just as the second bell rang, I entered
the drawing-room. There were
at least twenty guests present&mdash;each
guest, no doubt, some planet of fashion
or fame, with satellites of its own.
But I saw only two forms distinctly&mdash;first,
Lord Castleton, conspicuous
with star and garter, somewhat ampler
and portlier in proportions, and
with a frank dash of gray in the silky
waves of his hair, but still as pre-eminent
as ever for that beauty&mdash;the
charm of which depends less than
any other upon youth&mdash;arising, as it
does, from a felicitous combination of
bearing and manner, and that exquisite
suavity of expression which steals
into the heart, and pleases so much
that it becomes a satisfaction to admire!
Of Lord Castleton, indeed, it
might be said, as of Alcibiades, 'that
he was beautiful at every age.' I felt
my breath come thick, and a mist
passed before my eyes, as Lord Castleton
led me through the crowd, and
the radiant vision of Fanny Trevanion,
how altered&mdash;and how dazzling!&mdash;burst
upon me.</p>

<p>I felt the light touch of that hand
of snow; but no guilty thrill shot
through my veins. I heard the voice,
musical as ever&mdash;lower than it was
once, and more subdued in its key,
but steadfast and untremulous&mdash;it was
no longer the voice that made "my
soul plant itself in the ears."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>event was over, and I knew that the
dream had fled from the waking world
for ever.</p>

<p>"Another old friend!" as Lady
Ulverstone came forth from a little
group of children, leading one fine
boy of nine years old, while one, two
or three years younger, clung to her
gown. "Another old friend!&mdash;and,"
added Lady Ulverstone, after the first
kind greetings, "two new ones, when
the old are gone." The slight melancholy
left the voice, as, after presenting
to me the little viscount, she drew
forward the more bashful Lord Albert,
who indeed had something of his
grandsire's and namesake's look of refined
intelligence in his brow and eyes.</p>

<p>The watchful tact of Lord Castleton
was quick in terminating whatever
embarrassment might belong to these
introductions, as, leaning lightly on
my arm, he drew me forward, and
presented me to the guests more immediately
in our neighbourhood, who
seemed by their earnest cordiality to
have been already prepared for the
introduction.</p>

<p>Dinner was now announced, and I
welcomed that sense of relief and segregation
with which one settles into
one's own "particular" chair at your
large miscellaneous entertainments.</p>

<p>I stayed three days at that house.
How truly had Trevanion said that
Fanny would make "an excellent
great lady." What perfect harmony
between her manners and her position;
just retaining enough of the girl's seductive
gaiety and bewitching desire
to please, to soften the new dignity of
bearing she had unconsciously assumed&mdash;less,
after all, as great lady than as
wife and mother: with a fine breeding,
perhaps a little languid and artificial,
as compared with her lord's&mdash;which
sprang, fresh and healthful, wholly
from nature&mdash;but still so void of all
the chill of condescension, or the subtle
impertinence that belongs to that order
of the inferior <i>noblesse</i>, which boasts
the name of "exclusives;" with what
grace, void of prudery, she took the
adulation of the flutterers, turning
from them to her children, or escaping
lightly to Lord Castleton, with an
ease that drew round her at once the
protection of hearth and home.</p>

<p>And certainly Lady Castleton was
more incontestably beautiful than
Fanny Trevanion had been.</p>

<p>All this I acknowledged, not with a
sigh and a pang, but with a pure feeling
of pride and delight. I might have
loved madly and presumptuously, as
boys will do; but I had loved worthily;&mdash;the
love left no blush on my manhood;
and Fanny's very happiness
was my perfect and total cure of every
wound in my heart not quite scarred
over before. Had she been discontented,
sorrowful, without joy in the
ties she had formed, there might have
been more danger that I should brood
over the past, and regret the loss of
its idol. Here there was none. And
the very improvement in her beauty
had so altered its character&mdash;<i>so</i> altered&mdash;that
Fanny Trevanion and Lady
Castleton seemed two persons. And,
thus observing and listening to her, I
could now dispassionately perceive
such differences in our nature as
seemed to justify Trevanion's assertion,
which once struck me as so
monstrous, "that we should not have
been happy had fate permitted our
union." Pure-hearted and simple
though she remained in the artificial
world, still that world was her element;
its interests occupied her; its talk,
though just chastened from scandal,
flowed from her lips. To borrow the
words of a man who was himself a
courtier, and one so distinguished that
he could afford to sneer at Chesterfield,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
"<i>She</i> had the routine of that
style of conversation which is a sort
of gold leaf, that is a great embellishment
where it is joined to anything
else." I will not add, "but makes a
very poor figure by itself,"&mdash;for <i>that</i>
Lady Castleton's conversation certainly
did not do&mdash;perhaps, indeed,
because it was not "by itself"&mdash;and
the gold leaf was all the better for
being thin, since it could not cover
even the surface of the sweet and amiable
nature over which it was spread.
Still, this was not the mind in which
now, in maturer experience, I would
seek to find sympathy with manly
action, or companionship in the charms
of intellectual leisure.</p>

<p>There was about this beautiful
favourite of nature, and fortune a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>helplessness, which had even its
grace in that high station, and which
perhaps tended to insure her domestic
peace, for it served to attach her to
those who had won influence over her,
and was happily accompanied by a
most affectionate disposition. But
still, if less favoured by circumstances,
less sheltered from every wind that
could visit her too roughly&mdash;if, as the
wife of a man of inferior rank, she had
failed of that high seat and silken
canopy reserved for the spoiled darlings
of fortune&mdash;that helplessness might
have become querulous. I thought of
poor Ellen Bolding and her silken
shoes. Fanny Trevanion seemed to
have come into the world with silk
shoes&mdash;not to walk where there was
a stone or a briar! I heard something,
in the gossip of those around, that confirmed
this view of Lady Castleton's
character, while it deepened my admiration
of her lord, and showed me
how wise had been her choice, and
how resolutely he had prepared himself
to vindicate his own. One evening,
as I was sitting a little apart from the
rest, with two men of the London
world, to whose talk&mdash;for it ran upon
the <i>on-dits</i> and anecdotes of a region
long strange to me&mdash;I was a silent but
amused listener; one of the two said&mdash;"Well,
I don't know anywhere a
more excellent creature than Lady
Castleton; so fond of her children&mdash;and
her tone to Castleton so exactly
what it ought to be&mdash;so affectionate,
and yet, as it were, respectful. And
the more credit to her, if, as they say,
she was not in love with him when
she married, (to be sure, handsome as
he is, he is twice her age!) And no
woman could have been more flattered
and courted by Lotharios and lady-killers
than Lady Castleton has been.
I confess, to my shame, that Castleton's
luck puzzles me, for it is rather an
exception to my general experience."</p>

<p>"My dear * * *," said the other,
who was one of those wise men of
pleasure, who occasionally startle us
into wondering, how they come to be
so clever, and yet rest contented with
mere drawing-room celebrity&mdash;men
who seem always idle, yet appear to
have read everything; always indifferent
to what passes before them, yet
who know the characters and divine
the secrets of everybody&mdash;"my dear
* * *," said the gentleman, "you would
not be puzzled if you had studied Lord
Castleton, instead of her ladyship. Of
all the conquests ever made by Sedley
Beaudesert, when the two fairest
dames of the Faubourg are said to
have fought for his smiles in the <i>Bois
de Boulogne</i>&mdash;no conquest ever cost
him such pains, or so tasked his knowledge
of women, as that of his wife
after marriage! He was not satisfied
with her hand, he was resolved to have
her whole heart, 'one entire and perfect
chrysolite;' and he has succeeded!
Never was husband so watchful, and
so little jealous&mdash;never one who confided
so generously in all that was best
in his wife, yet was so alert in protecting
and guarding her wherever she
was weakest! When, in the second
year of marriage, that dangerous
German Prince Von Leibenfels attached
himself so perseveringly to
Lady Castleton, and the scandal-mongers
pricked up their ears in hopes
of a victim, I watched Castleton with
as much interest as if I had been looking
over Deschappelles playing at
chess. You never saw anything so
masterly: he pitted himself against his
highness with the cool confidence, not
of a blind spouse, but a fortunate rival.
He surpassed him in the delicacy of his
attentions, he outshone him by his
careless magnificence. Leibenfels had
the impertinence to send Lady Castleton
a bouquet of some rare flowers
just in fashion. Castleton, an hour
before, had filled her whole balcony
with the same costly exotics, as if they
were too common for nosegays, and
only just worthy to bloom for her a
day. Young and really accomplished
as Leibenfels is, Castleton eclipsed
him by his grace, and fooled him with
his wit: he laid little plots to turn his
mustache and guitar into ridicule;
he seduced him into a hunt with the
buckhounds, (though Castleton himself
had not hunted before, since he
was thirty,) and drew him, spluttering
German oaths, out of the slough of a
ditch; he made him the laughter of
the clubs; he put him fairly out of
fashion&mdash;and all with such suavity and
politeness, and bland sense of superiority,
that it was the finest piece of
high comedy you ever beheld. The
poor prince, who had been coxcomb
enough to lay a bet with a Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
as to his success with the English
in general, and Lady Castleton in
particular, went away with a face as
long as Don Quixote's. If you had
but seen him at S&mdash;&mdash; House, the night
before he took leave of the island, and
his comical grimace when Castleton
offered him a pinch of the Beaudesert
mixture! No! the fact is, that Castleton
made it the object of his existence,
the masterpiece of his art, to secure to
himself a happy home, and the entire
possession of his wife's heart. The
first two or three years, I fear, cost
him more trouble than any other man
ever took, with his own wife at least&mdash;but
he may now rest in peace; Lady
Castleton is won, and for ever."</p>

<p>As my gentleman ceased, Lord
Castleton's noble head rose above the
group standing round him; and I
saw Lady Castleton turn with a look
of well-bred fatigue from a handsome
young fop, who had affected to lower
his voice while he spoke to her, and,
encountering the eyes of her husband,
the look changed at once into one of
such sweet smiling affection, such
frank unmistakeable wife-like pride,
that it seemed a response to the assertion&mdash;"Lady
Castleton is won, and
for ever."</p>

<p>Yes, that story increased my admiration
for Lord Castleton: it showed
me with what forethought and earnest
sense of responsibility he had
undertaken the charge of a life, the
guidance of a character yet undeveloped;
it lastingly acquitted him of
the levity that had been attributed to
Sedley Beaudesert. But I felt more
than ever contented that the task had
devolved on one whose temper and
experience had so fitted him to discharge
it. That German prince made
me tremble from sympathy with the
husband, and in a sort of relative shudder
for myself! Had that episode
happened to me, I could never have
drawn "high comedy" from it!&mdash;I
could never have so happily closed
the fifth act with a pinch of the Beaudesert
mixture! No, no; to my
homely sense of man's life and employment,
there was nothing alluring
in the prospect of watching over the
golden tree in the garden, with a
"woe to the Argus, if Mercury once
lull him to sleep!" Wife of mine
shall need no watching save in sickness
and sorrow! Thank Heaven,
that my way of life does not lead
through the roseate thoroughfares, beset
with German princes laying bets
for my perdition, and fine gentlemen
admiring the skill with which I play at
chess for so terrible a stake! To each
rank and each temper, its own laws.
I acknowledge that Fanny is an excellent
marchioness, and Lord Castleton
an incomparable marquis. But,
Blanche! if I can win thy true simple
heart, I trust I shall begin at the fifth
act of high comedy, and say at the
altar&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CVII.</h3>

<p>I rode home on a horse my host
lent me; and Lord Castleton rode
part of the way with me, accompanied
by his two boys, who bestrode manfully
their Shetland ponies, and cantered
on before us. I paid some compliment
to the spirit and intelligence
of these children&mdash;a compliment they
well deserved.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the marquis,
with a father's becoming pride, "I
hope neither of them will shame his
grandsire, Trevanion. Albert (though
not quite the wonder poor Lady Ulverstone
declares him to be) is rather too
precocious; and it is all I can do to
prevent his being spoilt by flattery to
his cleverness, which, I think, is much
worse than even flattery to rank&mdash;a
danger to which, despite Albert's
destined inheritance, the elder brother
is more exposed. Eton soon takes
out the conceit of the latter and more
vulgar kind. I remember Lord&mdash;&mdash;
(you know what an unpretending
good-natured fellow he is now) strutting
into the play-ground, a raw boy
with his chin up in the air, and burly
Dick Johnson (rather a tuft-hunter
now, I'm afraid) coming up, and saying,
'Well, sir, and who the deuce are
you?' 'Lord&mdash;&mdash;,' says the poor
devil unconsciously, 'eldest son of the
Marquis of&mdash;&mdash;.' 'Oh, indeed!' cries
Johnson; 'then, there's one kick for
my lord, and two for the marquis!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
I am not fond of kicking, but I doubt
if anything ever did &mdash;&mdash; more good
than those those kicks! But" continued
Lord Castleton, "when one
flatters a boy for his cleverness, even
Eton itself cannot kick the conceit out
of him. Let him be last in the form,
and the greatest dunce ever flogged,
there are always people to say that
your public schools don't do for your
great geniuses. And it is ten to one
but what the father is plagued into
taking the boy home, and giving him
a private tutor, who fixes him into a
prig for ever. A coxcomb in dress,"
said the marquis smiling, "is a trifler
it would ill become me to condemn,
and I own that I would rather see a
youth a fop than a sloven; but a coxcomb
in ideas&mdash;why, the younger he is,
the more unnatural and disagreeable.
Now, Albert, over that hedge, sir."</p>

<p>"That hedge, papa? The pony
will never do it."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lord Castleton, taking
off his hat with politeness, "I fear
you will deprive us of the pleasure of
your company."</p>

<p>The boy laughed, and made gallantly
for the hedge, though I saw by
his change of colour that it a little
alarmed him. The pony could not
clear the hedge; but it was a pony of
tact and resources, and it scrambled
through like a cat, inflicting sundry
rents and tears on a jacket of Raphael
blue.</p>

<p>Lord Castleton said, smiling, "You
see I teach them to get through a
difficulty one way or the other. Between
you and me," he added seriously,
"I perceive a very different world
rising round the next generation from
that in which I first went forth and
took my pleasure. I shall rear my
boys accordingly. Rich noblemen
must now-a-days be useful men; and
if they can't leap over briars, they
must scramble through them. Don't
you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, heartily."</p>

<p>"Marriage makes a man much
wiser," said the marquis, after a pause.
"I smile now, to think how often I
sighed at the thought of growing old.
Now I reconcile myself to the gray
hairs without dreams of a wig, and
enjoy youth still&mdash;for" (pointing to his
sons) "it is <i>there</i>!"</p>

<p>"He has very nearly found out the
secret of the saffron bag now," said
my father, pleased, and rubbing his
hands, when I repeated this talk with
Lord Castleton. "But I fear poor
Trevanion," he added, with a compassionate
change of countenance, "is still
far away from the sense of Lord
Bacon's receipt. And his wife, you
say, out of very love for him, keeps
always drawing discord from the one
jarring wire."</p>

<p>"You must talk to her, sir."</p>

<p>"I will," said my father angrily;
"and scold her too&mdash;foolish woman!
I shall tell her Luther's advice to the
Prince of Anhalt."</p>

<p>"What was that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Only to throw a baby into the
river Maldon, because it had sucked
dry five wet-nurses besides the mother,
and must therefore be a changeling.
Why, that ambition of hers
would suck dry all the mothers' milk
in the genus mammalian! And such
a withered, rickety, malign little
changeling too! She shall fling it into
the river, by all that is holy!" cried
my father; and, suiting the action to
the word, away went the spectacles he
had been rubbing indignantly for the
last three minutes, into the pond.
"Pap&aelig;!" faltered my father aghast,
while the Ceprinid&aelig;, mistaking the
dip of the spectacles for an invitation
to dinner, came scudding up to the
bank. "It is all your fault," said Mr
Caxton, recovering himself. "Get
me the new tortoise-shell spectacles
and a large slice of bread. You see
that when fish are reduced to a pond
they recognise a benefactor, which
they never do when rising at flies, or
groping for worms, in the waste world
of a river. Hem!&mdash;a hint for the
Ulverstones. Besides the bread and
the spectacles, just look out and bring
me the old black-letter copy of St
Anthony's <i>Sermon to Fishes</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER CVIII.</h3>

<p>Some weeks now have passed since
my return to the Tower: the Castletons
are gone, and all Trevanion's gay
guests. And since these departures,
visits between the two houses have
been interchanged often, and the bonds
of intimacy are growing close. Twice
has my father held long conversations
apart with Lady Ulverstone, (my
mother is not foolish enough to feel a
pang now at such confidences,) and the
result has become apparent. Lady
Ulverstone has ceased all talk against
the world and the public&mdash;ceased to
fret the galled pride of her husband
with irritating sympathy. She has
made herself the true partner of his
present occupations, as she was of
those in the past; she takes interest
in farming, and gardens, and flowers,
and those philosophical peaches which
come from trees academical that Sir
William Temple reared in his graceful
retirement. She does more&mdash;she sits
by her husband's side in the library,
reads the books he reads, or, if in
Latin, coaxes him, into construing
them. Insensibly she leads him into
studies farther and farther remote from
Blue Books and Hansard; and, taking
my father's hint,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Allures to brighter worlds, and leads the way."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are inseparable. Darby-and-Joan-like,
you see them together in
the library, the garden, or the homely
little pony-phaeton, for which Lord
Ulverstone has resigned the fast-trotting
cob, once identified with the
eager looks of the busy Trevanion. It
is most touching, most beautiful! And
to think what a victory over herself
the proud woman must have obtained!&mdash;never
a thought that seems to murmur,
never a word to recall the ambitious
man back from the philosophy
into which his active mind flies for
refuge. And with the effort her brow
has become so serene! That careworn
expression, which her fine
features once wore, is fast vanishing.
And what affects me most, is to think
that this change (which is already settling
into happiness) has been wrought
by Austin's counsels and appeals to
her sense and affection. "It is to you,"
he said, "that Trevanion must look
for more than comfort&mdash;for cheerfulness
and satisfaction. Your child is
gone from you&mdash;the world ebbs away&mdash;you
two should be all in all to each
other. Be so." Thus, after paths so
devious, meet those who had parted
in youth, now on the verge of age.
There, in the same scenes where
Austin and Ellinor had first formed
acquaintance, he aiding her to soothe
the wounds inflicted by the ambition
that had separated their lots, and
both taking counsel to insure the happiness
of the rival she had preferred.</p>

<p>After all this vexed public life of
toil, and care, and ambition,&mdash;to see
Trevanion and Ellinor drawing closer
and closer to each other, knowing
private life and its charms for the first
time,&mdash;verily it would have been a
theme for an elegiast like Tibullus.</p>

<p>But all this while a younger love,
with no blurred leaves to erase from
the chronicle, has been keeping sweet
account of the summer time. "Very
near are two hearts that have no guile
between them," saith a proverb, traced
back to Confucius. O ye days of still
sunshine, reflected back from ourselves&mdash;O
ye haunts, endeared evermore by
a look, tone, or smile, or rapt silence,
when more and more with each hour,
unfolded before me that nature, so
tenderly coy, so cheerful though serious,
so attuned by simple cares to affection,
yet so filled, from soft musings
and solitude, with a poetry that gave
grace to duties the homeliest;&mdash;setting
life's trite things to music. Here
nature and fortune concurred alike:
equal in birth and pretensions&mdash;similar
in tastes and in objects,&mdash;loving
the healthful activity of purpose, but
content to find it around us&mdash;neither
envying the wealthy, nor vying with
the great; each framed by temper to
look on the bright side of life, and find
founts of delight, and green spots
fresh with verdure, where eyes but
accustomed to cities could see but the
sands and the mirage. While afar (as
man's duty) I had gone through the
travail that, in wrestling with fortune,
gives pause to the heart to recover its
losses, and know the value of love,
in its graver sense of life's earnest
realities; heaven had reared, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
thresholds of home, the young tree
that should cover the roof with its
blossoms, and embalm with its fragrance
the daily air of my being.</p>

<p>It had been the joint prayer of those
kind ones I left, that such might be
my reward; and each had contributed,
in his or her several way, to fit that
fair life for the ornament and joy of
the one that now asked to guard and
to cherish it. From Roland came that
deep, earnest honour&mdash;a man's in its
strength, and a woman's in its delicate
sense of refinement. From
Roland, that quick taste for all things
noble in poetry, and lovely in nature&mdash;the
eye that sparkled to read how
Bayard stood alone at the bridge, and
saved an army&mdash;or wept over the
page that told how the dying Sidney
put the bowl from his burning lips. Is
that too masculine a spirit for some?
Let each please himself. Give me
the woman who can echo all thoughts
that are noblest in man! And that
eye, too&mdash;like Roland's,&mdash;could pause
to note each finer mesh in the wonderful
webwork of beauty. No landscape
to her was the same yesterday
and to-day,&mdash;a deeper shade from the
skies could change the face of the
moors&mdash;the springing up of fresh wild
flowers, the very song of some bird
unheard before, lent variety to the
broad rugged heath. Is that too simple
a source of pleasure for some to
prize? Be it so to those who need the
keen stimulants that cities afford. But
if we were to pass all our hours in
those scenes, it was something to have
the tastes which own no monotony in
Nature.</p>

<p>All this came from Roland; and
to this, with thoughtful wisdom, my
father had added enough knowledge
from books to make those tastes
more attractive, and to lend to impulsive
perception of beauty and goodness
the culture that draws finer
essence from beauty, and expands the
Good into the Better by heightening
the site of the survey: hers, knowledge
enough to sympathise with
intellectual pursuits, not enough to
dispute on man's province&mdash;Opinion.
Still, whether in nature or in lore, still</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The fairest garden in her looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her mind the choicest books!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet, thou wise Austin&mdash;and thou
Roland, poet that never wrote a verse,&mdash;yet
your work had been incomplete,
but then Woman stept in, and the
mother gave to her she designed for a
daughter the last finish of meek everyday
charities&mdash;the mild household
virtues,&mdash;"the soft word that turneth
away wrath,"&mdash;the angelic pity for
man's rougher faults&mdash;the patience
that bideth its time&mdash;and, exacting no
"rights of woman," subjugates us,
delighted, to the invisible thrall.</p>

<p>Dost thou remember, my Blanche,
that soft summer evening when the
vows our eyes had long interchanged
stole at last from the lip? Wife mine!
come to my side,&mdash;look over me while
I write; there, thy tears&mdash;(happy
tears, are they not, Blanche?)&mdash;have
blotted the page! Shall we tell the
world more? Right, my Blanche, no
words should profane the place where
those tears have fallen!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here I would fain conclude;
but alas, and alas! that I cannot
associate with our hopes, on this side
the grave, him who, we fondly hoped,
(even on the bridal-day, that gave his
sister to my arms,) would come to the
hearth where his place now stood
vacant, contented with glory, and
fitted at last for the tranquil happiness,
which long years of repentance and
trial had deserved.</p>

<p>Within the first year of my marriage,
and shortly after a gallant share
in a desperate action, which had
covered his name with new honours,
just when we were most elated, in the
blinded vanity of human pride&mdash;came
the fatal news! The brief career was
run. He died, as I knew he would
have prayed to die, at the close of a
day ever memorable in the annals of
that marvellous empire, which valour
without parallel has annexed to the
Throne of the Isles. He died in the
arms of Victory, and his last smile
met the eyes of the noble chief who,
even in that hour, could pause from
the tide of triumph by the victim it
had cast on its bloody shore. "One
favour," faltered the dying man; "I
have a father at home&mdash;he too is a
soldier. In my tent is my will: it
gives all I have to him&mdash;he can take
it without shame. That is not enough!
Write to him&mdash;you&mdash;with your own
hand, and tell him how his son fell!"
And the hero fulfilled the prayer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
that letter is dearer to Roland than
all the long roll of the ancestral dead!
Nature has reclaimed her rights, and
the forefathers recede before the son.</p>

<p>In a side chapel of the old Gothic
church, amidst the mouldering tombs
of those who fought at Acre and Agincourt,
a fresh tablet records the death
of <span class="smcap">Herbert de Caxton</span>, with the
simple inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HE FELL ON THE FIELD:</p>

<p class="center">HIS COUNTRY MOURNED HIM,</p>

<p class="center">AND HIS FATHER IS RESIGNED.
</p>

<p>Years have rolled away since that
tablet was placed there, and changes
have passed on that nook of earth
which bounds our little world: fair
chambers have sprung up amidst the
desolate ruins; far and near, smiling
corn-fields replace the bleak, dreary
moors. The land supports more retainers
than ever thronged to the
pennon of its barons of old; and Roland
can look from his tower over
domains that are reclaimed, year by
year, from the waste, till the ploughshare
shall win a lordship more opulent
than those feudal chiefs ever held
by the tenure of the sword. And the
hospitable mirth that had fled from
the ruin has been renewed in the hall;
and rich and poor, great and lowly,
have welcomed the rise of an ancient
house from the dust of decay. All
those dreams of Roland's youth are
fulfilled; but they do not gladden his
heart as does the thought that his son,
at the last, was worthy of his line, and
the hope that no gulf shall yawn between
the two when the Grand
Circle is rounded, and man's past
and man's future meet where Time
disappears. Never was that lost one
forgotten!&mdash;never was his name
breathed but tears rushed to the eyes;
and, each morning, the peasant going
to his labour might see Roland steal
down the dell to the deep-set door of
the chapel. None presume there to
follow his steps, or intrude on his
solemn thoughts; for there, in sight
of that tablet, are his orisons made,
and the remembrance of the dead
forms a part of the commune with
heaven. But the old man's step is
still firm, and his brow still erect; and
you may see in his face that it was no
hollow boast which proclaimed that
the "father was resigned:" and ye,
who doubt if too Roman a hardness
might not be found in that Christian
resignation, think what it is to have
feared for a son the life of shame, and
ask, then, if the sharpest grief to a
father is in a son's death of honour.</p>

<p>Years have passed, and two fair
daughters play at the knees of Blanche
or creep round the footstool of Austin,
waiting patiently for the expected
kiss when he looks up from the Great
Book, now drawing fast to its close;
or, if Roland enter the room, forget
all their sober demureness, and, unawed
by the terrible "Pap&aelig;!" run
clamorous for the promised swing in
the orchard, or the fiftieth recital of
"Chevy Chase."</p>

<p>For my part, I take the goods the
gods provide me, and am contented
with girls that have the eyes of their
mother; but Roland, ungrateful man,
begins to grumble that we are so neglectful
of the rights of heirs-male.
He is in doubt whether to lay the
fault on Mr Squills or on us: I am
not sure that he does not think it a
conspiracy of all three to settle the
representation of the martial De Caxtons
on "the spindle side." Whosoever
be the right person to blame,
an omission so fatal to the straight
line in the pedigree is rectified at last;
and Mrs Primmins again rushes, or
rather rolls&mdash;in the movement natural
to forms globular and spheral&mdash;into
my father's room with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, sir&mdash;it is a boy!"</p>

<p>Whether my father asked also this
time that question so puzzling to
metaphysical inquirers, "What is a
boy?" I know not; I rather suspect
he had not leisure for so abstract a
question: for the whole household
burst on him, and my mother, in that
storm peculiar to the elements of the
Mind Feminine&mdash;a sort of sunshiny
storm between laughter and crying&mdash;whirled
him off to behold the <i>Neogilos</i>.</p>

<p>Now, some months after that date,
on a winter's evening, we were all
assembled in the hall, which was still
our usual apartment, since its size
permitted to each his own segregated
and peculiar employment. A large
screen fenced off from interruption my
father's erudite settlement; and quite
out of sight, behind that impermeable
barrier, he was now calmly winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
up that eloquent peroration which will
astonish the world whenever, by
Heaven's special mercy, the printer's
devils have done with "The History
of Human Error." In another nook
my uncle had ensconced himself&mdash;stirring
his coffee, (in the cup my
mother had presented to him so many
years ago, and which had miraculously
escaped all the ills the race of
crockery is heir to,) a volume of
<i>Ivanhoe</i> in the other hand: and, despite
the charm of the Northern
Wizard, his eye <i>not</i> on the page. On
the wall behind him, hangs the picture
of Sir Herbert de Caxton, the soldier-comrade
of Sidney and Drake; and,
at the foot of the picture, Roland has
slung his son's sword beside the letter
that spoke of his death, which is
framed and glazed: sword and letter
had become as the last, nor least
honoured, Penates of the hall:&mdash;the
son was grown an ancestor.</p>

<p>Not far from my uncle sat Mr
Squills, employed in mapping out
phrenological divisions on a cast he
had made from the skull of one of the
Australian aborigines&mdash;a ghastly present
which (in compliance with a
yearly letter to that effect) I had
brought him over, together with a
stuffed "wombat" and a large bundle
of sarsaparilla. (For the satisfaction
of his patients, I may observe, parenthetically,
that the skull and the
"wombat"&mdash;that last is a creature
between a miniature pig and a very
small badger&mdash;were not precisely
packed up with the sarsaparilla!) Farther
on stood open, but idle, the new
pianoforte, at which, before my father
had given his preparatory hem, and
sat down to the Great Book, Blanche
and my mother had been trying hard
to teach me to bear the third in the
glee of "The Chough and Crow to
roost have gone,"&mdash;vain task, in spite
of all flattering assurances that I have
a very fine "bass," if I could but
manage to humour it. Fortunately
for the ears of the audience, that attempt
is now abandoned. My mother
is hard at work on her tapestry&mdash;the
last pattern in fashion&mdash;to wit, a rosy-cheeked
young troubadour playing the
lute under a salmon-coloured balcony:
the two little girls look gravely
on, prematurely in love, I suspect,
with the troubadour; and Blanche and
I have stolen away into a corner, which,
by some strange delusion, we consider
out of sight, and in that corner is the
cradle of the <i>Neogilos</i>. Indeed it is not
our fault that it is there&mdash;Roland
would have it so; and the baby is so
good, too, he never cries&mdash;at least so
say Blanche and my mother: at all
events he does not cry to-night. And
indeed, that child is a wonder! He
seems to know and respond to what
was uppermost at our hearts when he
was born; and yet more, when Roland
(contrary, I dare say, to all custom)
permitted neither mother, nor
nurse, nor creature of womankind, to
hold him at the baptismal font, but
bent over the new Christian his own
dark, high-featured face, reminding
one of the eagle that hid the infant
in its nest, and watched over it with
wings that had battled with the storm:
and from that moment the child, who
took the name of <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>, seemed
to recognise Roland better than his
nurse, or even mother&mdash;seemed to
know that, in giving him that name,
we sought to give Roland his son
once more! Never did the old man
come near the infant but it smiled
and crowed, and stretched out its
little arms; and then the mother and I
would press each other's hands secretly,
and were not jealous. Well, then,
Blanche and Pisistratus were seated
near the cradle, and talking in low
whispers, when my father pushed
aside the screen and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There&mdash;the work is done! and
now it may go to press as soon as
you will."</p>

<p>Congratulations poured in&mdash;my
father bore them with his usual equanimity;
and standing on the hearth,
his hand in his waistcoat, he said
musingly, "Among the last delusions
of Human Error, I have had to notice
Rousseau's phantasy of Perpetual
Peace, and all the like pastoral dreams,
which preceded the bloodiest wars
that have convulsed the earth for
more than a thousand years!"</p>

<p>"And to judge by the newspapers,"
said I, "the same delusions are renewed
again. Benevolent theorists
go about, prophesying peace as a
positive certainty, deduced from that
sibyl-book the ledger; and we are
never again to buy cannons, provided

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Squills</span>, (<i>who, having almost
wholly retired from general business,
has, from want of something better to
do, attended sundry "Demonstrations
in the North," since which he has talked
much about the march of improvement,
the spirit of the age, and</i> "<small>US</small> <i>of the
nineteenth century."</i>)&mdash;I heartily hope
that these benevolent theorists <i>are</i>
true prophets. I have found, in the
course of my professional practice,
that men go out of the world quite
fast enough, without hacking them
into pieces, or blowing them up into
the air. War is a great evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, (<i>passing by Squills, and
glancing towards Roland</i>.)&mdash;Hush!</p>

<p>Roland remains silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;War is a great evil;
but evil is admitted by Providence
into the agency of creation, physical
and moral. The existence of evil has
puzzled wiser heads than ours, Squills.
But, no doubt, there is One above
who has His reasons for it. The
combative bump seems as common to
the human skull as the philoprogenitive;
if it is in our organisation, be
sure it is not there without cause.
Neither is it just to man, nor wisely
submissive to the Disposer of all
events, to suppose that war is wholly
and wantonly produced by human
crimes and follies&mdash;that it conduces
<i>only</i> to ill, and does not as often arise
from the necessities interwoven in the
framework of society, and speed the
great ends of the human race, conformably
with the designs of the Omniscient.
Not one great war has ever
desolated the earth, but has left behind
it seeds that have ripened into blessings
incalculable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Squills</span>, (<i>with the groan of a
dissentient at a "Demonstration."</i>)&mdash;Oh!
oh! <small>OH!</small></p>

<p>Luckless Squills! Little could he
have foreseen the shower-bath, or
rather <i>douche</i>, of erudition that fell
splash on his head, as he pulled the
spring with that impertinent <i>Oh! oh!</i>
Down first came the Persian War,
with Median myriads disgorging all
the rivers they had drunk up in their
march through the East&mdash;all the arts,
all the letters, all the sciences, all the
notions of liberty that we inherit from
Greece&mdash;my father rushed on with
them all, sousing Squills with his
proofs that, without the Persian War,
Greece would never have risen to
be the teacher of the world. Before
the gasping victim could take
breath, down came Hun, Goth, and
Vandal, on Italy and Squills.</p>

<p>"What, sir!" cried my father,
"don't you see that, from those eruptions
on demoralised Rome, came the
regeneration of manhood; the re-baptism
of earth from the last soils of
paganism; and the remote origin of
whatever of Christianity yet exists,
free from the idolatries with which
Rome contaminated the faith?"</p>

<p>Squills held up his hands, and made
a splutter. Down came Charlemagne&mdash;paladins
and all! There
my father was grand! What a picture
he made of the broken, jarring,
savage elements of barbaric society.
And the iron hand of the great Frank&mdash;settling
the nations, and founding
existent Europe. Squills was now
fast sinking into coma, or stupefaction;
but, catching at a straw, as he heard
the word "Crusades" he stuttered
forth, "Ah! <i>there</i> I defy you!"</p>

<p>"Defy me, there!" cries my father;
and one would think the ocean was in
the shower-bath, it came down with
such a rattle. My father scarcely
touched on the smaller points in excuse
for the Crusades, though he recited
very volubly all the humane
arts introduced into Europe by that
invasion of the East; and showed
how it had served civilisation, by the
vent it afforded for the rude energies
of chivalry&mdash;by the element of destruction
to feudal tyranny that it
introduced&mdash;by its use in the emancipation
of burghs, and the disrupture
of serfdom. But he showed, in colours
vivid as if caught from the skies of the
East, the great spread of Mahometanism,
and the danger it menaced to
Christian Europe&mdash;and drew up the
Godfreys, and Tancreds, and Richards,
as a league of the Age and Necessity,
against the terrible progress of the
sword and the Koran. "You call
them madmen," cried my father, "but
the frenzy of nations is the statesmanship
of fate! How know you that&mdash;but
for the terror inspired by the hosts
who marched to Jerusalem&mdash;how
know you that the Crescent had not
waved over other realms than those
which Roderic lost to the Moor? If
Christianity had been less a passion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
and the passion had less stirred up all
Europe&mdash;how know you that the creed
of the Arab (which was then, too, a
passion) might not have planted its
mosques in the forum of Rome, and
on the site of Notre Dame? For in
the war between creeds&mdash;when the
creeds are embraced by vast races&mdash;think
you that the reason of sages can
cope with the passion of millions?
Enthusiasm must oppose enthusiasm.
The crusader fought for the tomb of
Christ, but he saved the life of Christendom."</p>

<p>My father paused. Squills was quite
passive; he struggled no more&mdash;he was
drowned.</p>

<p>"So," resumed Mr Caxton, more
quietly&mdash;"so, if later wars yet perplex
us as to the good that the All-wise
One draws from their evils, our
posterity may read their uses as clearly
as we now read the finger of
Providence resting on the barrows of
Marathon, or guiding Peter the Hermit
to the battle-fields of Palestine.
Nor, while we admit the evil to the
passing generation, can we deny that
many of the virtues that make the
ornament and vitality of peace sprang
up first in the convulsions of war!"
Here Squills began to evince faint
signs of resuscitation, when my father
let fly at him one of those numberless
waterworks which his prodigious
memory kept in constant supply.
"Hence," said he, "hence not unjustly
has it been remarked by a philosopher,
shrewd at least in worldly
experience&mdash;(Squills again closed his
eyes, and became exanimate)&mdash;'It is
strange to imagine that war, which of
all things appears the most savage,
should be the passion of the most
heroic spirits. But 'tis in war that
the knot of fellowship is closest drawn;
It is in war that mutual succour is most
given&mdash;mutual danger run, and common
affection most exerted and employed;
for heroism and philanthropy
are almost one and the same!'"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>My father ceased, and mused a
little. Squills, if still living, thought
it prudent to feign continued extinction.</p>

<p>"Not," said Mr Caxton, resuming&mdash;"not
but what I hold it our duty
never to foster into a passion what we
must rather submit to as an awful
necessity. You say truly, Mr Squills&mdash;war
is an evil; and woe to those
who, on slight pretences, open the
gates of Janus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;'The dire abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fierce issues of the furious god.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr Squills, after a long pause,
(employed in some of the more handy
means for the reanimation of submerged
bodies, supporting himself
close to the fire in a semi-erect posture,
with gentle friction, self-applied,
to each several limb, and copious recourse
to certain steaming stimulants
which my compassionate hands prepared
for him,) stretches himself, and
says feebly, "In short, then, not to
provoke further discussion, you would
go to war in defence of your country.
Stop, sir&mdash;stop, for God's sake! I
agree with you&mdash;I agree with you!
But, fortunately, there is little chance
now that any new Boney will build
boats at Boulogne to invade us."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;I am not so sure of
that, Mr Squills. (<i>Squills falls back
with a glassy stare of deprecating horror.</i>)
I don't read the newspapers
very often, but the past helps me to
judge of the present.</p>

<p>Therewith my father earnestly recommended
to Mr Squills the careful
perusal of certain passages in Thucydides,
just previous to the outbreak
of the Peloponnesian War, (<i>Squills
hastily nodded the most servile acquiescence</i>,)
and drew an ingenious parallel
between the signs and symptoms
foreboding that outbreak, and the very
apprehension of coming war which
was evinced by the recent <i>Io p&aelig;ans</i>
to peace. And, after sundry notable
and shrewd remarks, tending to show
where elements for war were already
ripening, amidst clashing opinions and
disorganised states, he wound up with
saying,&mdash;"So that, all things considered,
I think we had better just
keep up enough of the bellicose spirit,
not to think it a sin if we are called
upon to fight for our pestles and mortars,
our three per cents, goods, chattels,
and liberties. Such a time must
come, sooner or later, even though
the whole world were spinning cotton,
and printing sprigged calicoes. <i>We</i>
may not see it, Squills, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>young gentleman in the cradle, whom
you have lately brought into light,
may."</p>

<p>"And if so," said my uncle abruptly,
speaking for the first time&mdash;"if indeed
it is for altar and hearth!"</p>

<p>My father suddenly drew in and
pished a little, for he saw that he was
caught in the web of his own eloquence.</p>

<p>Then Roland took down from the
wall his son's sword. Stealing to the
cradle, he laid it in its sheath by the
infant's side, and glanced from my
father to us with a beseeching eye.
Instinctively Blanche bent over the
cradle, as if to protect the <i>Neogilos</i>;
but the child, waking, turned from
her, and, attracted by the glitter of
the hilt, laid one hand lustily thereon,
and pointed with the other, laughingly,
to Roland.</p>

<p>"Only on my father's proviso," said
I hesitatingly. "For hearth and altar&mdash;nothing
less!"</p>

<p>"And even in that case," said my
father, "add the shield to the sword!"
and on the other side of the infant he
placed Roland's well-worn Bible,
blistered in many a page with secret
tears.</p>

<p>There we all stood, grouping round
the young centre of so many hopes
and fears&mdash;in peace or in war, born
alike for the Battle of Life. And he,
unconscious of all that made our lips
silent, and our eyes dim, had already
left that bright bauble of the sword,
and thrown both arms round Roland's
bended neck.</p>

<p>"<i>Herbert</i>," murmured Roland; and
Blanche gently drew away the sword,&mdash;and
left the Bible.</p>

<h2><a name="LYNMOUTH_REVISITED" id="LYNMOUTH_REVISITED">LYNMOUTH REVISITED.</a></h2>


<p class="center">BY THE SKETCHER.
</p>

<p>Nearly sixteen years ago, there
appeared in the pages of Maga, descriptions
of the scenery of Lynmouth,
North Devon. As Sketcher, I then
proposed to myself to analyse the
impressions which landscape scenery
makes upon the minds of artists and
lovers of nature, and to show that
there must be in the artist a higher
aim than imitation; and that the
pleasure of the unpractising admirer
will be in proportion to his power of
extracting from the insensitive matter
of nature, the poetic life of thought;
to rescue both art and nature from
the degradation they suffer when disconnected
with the higher senses; to
show that nature, to be the worthy object
of art, should be suggestive. Its
charm is to elicit, to draw out finely,
and to embellish what is already, in a
ruder state, in the mind. If there be
poverty within, there is no room for
the reception of the riches so profusely
surrounding us in the external world.
Neither artists nor amateurs are generally
sufficiently aware, that a previous
education is necessary to make
sketching effective and expressive.
We find <i>ourselves</i> everywhere. Whatever
be the scenery, the sketcher
brings little back that he does not
take with him. Hence the diversity
in the character of sketches&mdash;of different
sketchers&mdash;and the one character
that pervades the portfolio of each.
I have heard of an artist who visited
our lakes, and brought back with him
only cottages! Morland would have
added, or rather made the principal,
the stye and pigs; and even Gainsborough's
sketch-book may have
shown little more than ragged pollards,
and groups of rustic children.
To know what is in nature, you must
know what is in yourself. If you are
ignorant of art, your sketches can
only be accidentally good. It is possible
to be a very close observer, even
of minute beauties, and yet be a very
bad sketcher. One of an original
genius will convert, and, by a bold
dissimilitude in non-essentials, incorporate
into his own previous conceptions
whatever is before him; and
thus, by preserving the great suggestive
characteristics, represent nature
with a far greater truth, exhibiting
her very life and feeling, than they
who aim at truth through exact and
minute imitation.</p>

<p>Let this be exemplified in Salvator
Rosa. Do his wild scenes of rock,
and rugged rock-engendered trees,
exist to the general eye, exactly in
their form, and colour, and composition,
as he has represented them?
The exact sketcher would have found
a less correspondence in branches and
foliage&mdash;a less marked living feeling
between the rocks and trees; he
would have found much in the colouring,
especially in the green leaves,
where they are so few and scattered,
of an inconsistent gaiety. These
would have been distracting; but his
educated eye, toned by a one bold
feeling, rejected these, and seized the
wilder characteristic, to which he
resolutely, under the impulse of his
genius, made all the rest subservient
and suggestive. He embodied what
he saw with what he felt, and marred
not the savage freedom by attractive
littlenesses, but gave it full play;
and with an execution as bold and
free, which the minute critic would
pronounce not natural, though most
natural, as most expressive of that
spontaneous out-flung unconstrained-ness
of nature's growth, which really
pervades all, he harmoniously brought
all the parts under the dominion of
one poetic feeling. Take his foliage,
even in form&mdash;to say nothing of its
actual unnaturalness of colour in the
exact sense&mdash;there is a raggedness, as
torn and storm-beaten, in the individual
leafage, which the untutored
sketcher will in vain look for in his
beat; but all this stamps one great
truth, and that speaks more of nature
than many small ones. I do not
mean here to give the palm to Salvator
Rosa, as if he were "Lord of
Landscape;" I mention him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
strong example, as the boldest deviator
from that which the unpoetic
eye sees, and minds totally uncharmed
by poetry can conceive.
I think it well here to lay some stress
upon these preliminary remarks, because
much has been written, with a
great fascination of language, recommending,
as I believe too strongly, a
close observation in detail of the phenomena
of nature; overlooking the
great phenomenon&mdash;the accordance of
external nature with the heart, feelings,
and very life and soul of man.
One writer in particular, with great
ability, and audacious confidence, because
in his blindness he, uneducated
to it, sees not in nature what such
great men as Salvator Rosa and
Gaspar Poussin, have extracted from
it, and yet made it nature's and their
own, flings upon their established
fame the <i>brutum fulmen</i> of his contempt
and abuse. <i>Damnat quod non
intelligit.</i> He knows not the true
principles of art which exist to perfection
in their works, nor knows how
strictly these principles belong to art
and nature only through and by their
connexion with the mind of man.
You may study meteorology in the
<i>Penny Magazine</i>, or geology and
botany, most scientifically; but it will
further you a very little way, while
your portfolio is under your arm, and
your eye in search of a picturesque
which you have not learned to find.
Nay, it may happen, for it often does
happen, that the more you sketch
the farther you are from art. It is
possible, also, for the most accomplished
artist to sketch too much;
and to stay the power of his invention,
by referring too constantly to the preciseness
and individuality of scenery.
He dares not so much trust his palette
as his portfolio, as it were his register
of nature, to which he has bound himself
beyond the usual apprenticeship.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by sketchers,
amateurs, and artists by profession,
that, upon a sketching expedition,
"their hands are not in" for some
days. I doubt if the fault be so much
in the hand as in the eye; for in most
cases the hand had come from the
immediate practice of the studio:
but the eye is distracted by the many
beauties which now force themselves
into observation, and which in the
home-practice, and in following the
mind's bent on the canvass, the
memory did not vividly present as not
wanted. It is more difficult, therefore,
at first to generalise, to escape
the fascinations of local form and
colour, which keep the eye from the
instant acknowledgment of a whole.
We are thus at first apt to begin with
the detail, instead of leaving it to the
last, by which means we have more
than we want, or less accurately and
accommodatingly what is wanted.
When we have learned again to
reject, and to see, we are surprised
with a facility we at first despaired of.
We do, then, because we know what
to do.</p>

<p>I would recommend therefore, before
setting out on such expeditions,
where it be practicable, to visit daily,
and all day, during a week or fortnight,
the best galleries of pictures, such as
contain all schools, that as much as
possible there may be no bias, but
such as every one must find in himself
before he reaches the gallery. I
would do this to confirm, and fasten
upon the memory, the principles of
art,&mdash;breadth, greatness, truth, expression,
colouring, sentiment, and
how obtained. Here will be a grammar
without its drudgery; for every
lesson will be a delight, if we go to it
with no conceited opinions of our own,
and no cavilling spirit bringing ourselves
down to an admission that these
great men of former days had some
foundation upon which they built their
fame, their acknowledged fame&mdash;so
searching, we shall see the reasons of
their doings&mdash;why they, each for their
own purpose, adopted this or that
style of colour, or of composition, or
chiaroscuro. Going then immediately
to nature from art, we shall
see how very true art is&mdash;a secret that,
without this immediate comparison,
would be very apt to be hidden from
us. No man in his senses would begin
a science from his own observation
alone. It was not the first shepherd
who, studying the stars, laid open the
study of astronomy. We shall learn
nothing by despising all that has been
learnt before we were born. So it is
in art; some principles have been
established, which it is well to know
thoroughly; and, the more we know
them, the more enthusiastic will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
our admiration, the love of art through
nature, and of nature through art.</p>

<p>During my former visits to the
beautiful scenery of Lynmouth, I had
seldom taken any whole view, but
chiefly studied parts for use in the
detail of compositions; and this I
think to be a good practice for the
landscape painter, which term I use
here in contradistinction to the painter
of views, there is so great a
pleasure in as it were creating&mdash;in
being the &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#962;, the maker&mdash;that, to
one accustomed to and at all skilled
in composing, it becomes an irksome
task to make a "view." The continued
habit of view-painting must
necessarily check invention, and
limit unworthily the painter's aim.
In revisiting Lynmouth, I changed
my purpose and this, not under the
idea of making pictures of any of the
sketches, but for the practice of noting
how a picture, framed in from
nature, as if it were a work of art,
would be brought to its completion;
for sketching, with such an object, I
cannot but think of as great importance
as the other method. We must
learn from nature to make a whole,
as well as the use of the parts separately.
With this purpose the
sketcher will look out for subjects,
not detail; he will be curious to see
how nature composes now, and when
it is that scenes are most agreeable&mdash;made
so by what combination of lines,
by what agreement of colours, by
what proportions of light, and gradations
of shadow: for he will often find,
when nature looks her best, that light
and shade are employed as substitutes
for lines which, in the actual and true
drawing of them, would be unfortunate.
How often is it that a scene
strikes the eye at once for its great
beauty, that, when we come to it again,
seems entirely to have lost its charm!
Now these spots should be visited
again and again, till the causes be
ascertained of the charm and of the
deterioration: for here must lie the
principles of art, nature assuming and
putting off that which is most agreeable
to us, that in which our human
sympathies are engaged. Sketchers
often pass hastily these spots that are
no longer beautiful; but they are
wrong, for they can learn best, by
accurate observation of the changes
presented to them. And they will
thus learn to remedy deficiencies,
and acquire a better power of selecting
scenes, by knowing where the deficiencies
lie; the mind's eye will not
dwell upon them, or will fill them up,
and the composition show itself to
them in a manner quite otherwise than
it would have appeared, had no such
previous observations been made.
There are sometimes good lines marred
by bad effects, and bad lines remedied
by skilful management of effects&mdash;of
light and shadow. It must be a
practised eye that can properly abstract
and separate lines from effects,
and effects from lines. We play with
colour, but our serious business is
with light and shade; the real picture
is more frequently in black and white,
than those who addict themselves to
colour will credit. I will here but
refer to some passages in the early
numbers of <i>The Sketcher</i>, on the composition
of lines, wherein I showed,
and I believe truly explained, the
principle of composition upon which
many of the old masters worked. And
I particularly exemplified the principle
in the pictures of Gaspar Poussin,
whom Thompson calls learned Poussin,
(unless he meant Nicolo, who,
though in other respects he may with
equal justice be called learned, is, in
this art of the composition of lines, in
no way to be compared with his
brother-in-law.) I showed that there
was one simple rule which he invariably
adopted. We may likewise go
to nature, and find the rule there,
when nature, as a composition, looks
her best.</p>

<p>I think it will be found that any
scene is most pleasing when its variety
is in the smallest portion&mdash;that
is, when the greatest part of the picture
is made up of the most simple
and pervading lines, and the intricacies,
all variety, and alternations,
and interchanges of lines and parts,
shall be confined to a very small portion;
for thus a greatness, a largeness,
an importance, is preserved and
heightened, and at the same time,
monotony is avoided&mdash;though there
be much in it, the piece is not
crowded. There is a print from a
picture by Smith of Chichester, who,
by the bye, obtained the prize, against
Richard Wilson, which attracted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
attention the other day at a print-seller's
window. It was meant, I
presume, as an imitation of Claude,
Claude reduced to the then English
vulgarity. If multiplicity of parts
would make a picture, doubtless
Richard Wilson, with his simple,
sweeping, free lines, could have no
chance in competition with such a
painter. Every niche was crowded&mdash;and
equally so&mdash;every niche might
have made a picture, such as it was,
but all the niches made none, or a
bad one. Why, the variety was universal;
it should have been confined
to the smaller space. The picture is
objectionable in other points of view;
but this ignorance of the very nature
of composition was fatal. Yet this
work was evidently an imitation of
Claude, whose variety, however, of
distance, the modern imitator brought
into his very foreground. He could
not see the simplicity of Claude.
Not that Claude himself was a learned
composer; his lines are often incongruous,
and there is not unfrequently
a poverty of design, scarcely concealed
by the magic of his colouring.
Now, I find, in looking over my
sketches, that I had selected those
scenes where the passages of variety
lay in the distance, and, it being a
narrow valley, they occupied but a
small space; but, though small, it
was mostly the place of interest&mdash;there
was the more vivid light or the
deeper shade, the change, the life of
the picture, and the embellished way
of escape out of a defile, that from
its closeness would have been otherwise
painful. In saying "painful," I
seem to point to a defect in this
Lynmouth valley. Indeed, it will
not suit those who do not love close
scenery. That certainly is its character.
Yet is it not so close, but that
there is room for this kind of variety.
I think what I have said upon this
point, of interest and variety lying in
the smaller portion of the canvass&mdash;for
I here speak even of nature as a
picture&mdash;may be applicable generally
to light. I imagine those scenes will
be found most pleasing, where the
light is by far the smallest portion,
the half-tone by far the larger, and
the dark but to show the power of
both. Take, for instance, a garden
scene&mdash;a broad walk, trees on each
side&mdash;all is in broad light, but all is
in painful glare, monotony, and sameness
of endless detail. Let a shadow
pass over it, a broad shadow&mdash;or
rather a half-tone of light, that shall
only show the local colour subdued&mdash;how,
let a gleam pass across it, and
just touch here and there the leafage,
and seem to escape behind it&mdash;how
small is the light, but it has given
life to the picture. I cannot but
think it a fault of our day that half-tone
is neglected; light is made a
glare, and therefore the very object of
light is lost. I believe it was the
aim at a mere novelty that first introduced
this false principle. It was
recommended to Guido, but he failed
in it: pictures so painted by him are
far from being his best. Rubens
erred in it; but modern artists have
carried the false principle to the utmost
limit; and, in doing so, are
liable to a palpable incongruity;
an impossibility in nature, which they
profess to imitate. For it is the property
of light to take away colour;
yet in this school, the whitest light,
and the most vivid colours, are in the
same piece. The old painters, aware
of this property of light, in their out-of-door
scenes, avoid, not to say a
white, but even a light sky&mdash;especially
the Venetian&mdash;so that their great
depth and power of colour was rendered
natural, by the depth of their
skies. Their blues were dark&mdash;intensely
so&mdash;but they were sustained
by the general colour. If it be said the
Italian skies are notoriously the bluest,
Mr Ruskin has, in contradiction, pronounced
them to be white, but I believe
the fact is, that the great painters
considered colour, as a beauty in
art, <i>sui generis</i>, and that there was no
need of a slavish adherence, in this
respect, to nature herself. Indeed,
they delighted, even when aiming at the
richest colouring, to subdue all
glare, and to preserve rather a deep
half-tone.</p>

<p>I believe they studied nature through
coloured glasses; and we learn from
Mrs Merrifield that Gaspar Poussin
used a black mirror, which had been
bequeathed to him by Bamboccio.
The works of some of the Flemish
painters evidently show that they used
such a mirror.</p>

<p>Have I not, then, reached Lynmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
yet? I found it in full leafage,
and the little river as clear as amber,
and like it in colour. It is always
beautiful, and variable too&mdash;after rain
it assumes more variety of colour, and
of great richness. For most part of
the time of my visit, it was more shallow
than I had ever seen it. I was
pleased that it was so, though I heard
many complaints on that score. To
those who sketch close to the water,
it is, in fact, an advantage; for where
the scenery is so confined, it is a great
thing to be able to reach the large
stones in mid-stream, and thus many
new views are obtained; and when
you are pretty close to water, whether
it be a fall, or still, there is really but
very little difference whether the river
be full or not&mdash;the falls still retain
sufficient body, and the still pools are
sufficiently wide.</p>

<p>There are but two parties who know
anything of the painter-scenery of
Lynmouth&mdash;the sketchers and the
anglers. The common road generally
taken by tourists shows not half the
beauty of the place. Did Lynmouth
appear less beautiful?&mdash;certainly not.
I easily recognised the chosen spots,
and was surprised to find what little
change had taken place. I knew individual
trees perfectly, and, strange
to say, they did not seem to have acquired
growth. There were apparently the
same branches stretching
over the stream.</p>

<p>In one spot where large ledges of
rock shoot out in mid-stream, down
whose grooves the river rushes precipitously,
(I had, sixteen years ago,
sketched the scene,) there was growing
out of the edge of the rock a young
ash-tree shoot&mdash;to my surprise, there
it was still, or the old had decayed,
and a similar had sprang up. There
is something remarkable in this continued
identity, year after year, as if
the law of mutability had been suspended.
Yet there were changes.
I remember sketching by a little fall
of the river, where further progress
was staid by a large mass of projecting
rock. I felt sure there must be
fine subjects beyond, and in my attempt
to reach it from the opposite
side by climbing, and holding by the
boughs of a tree, one broke off, and I
fell into the cauldron. I found now
that the whole mass of this ledge of
rock had given way, and opened a
passage, and one of no great difficulty.
Here, as I suspected, were some very
fine studies. The place where I descended
is about half a mile, or less,
from Lynmouth, where the road turns,
near to a little bridge across a watercourse
intercepting the road. The
view of this little fall from above is
singularly beautiful; and, being so
much elevated, you see the bed of the
river continuous for a long distance,
greatly varied. I know no place
where there are such fine studies of
this kind, though they are rarely
taken, being only parts for composition&mdash;the
whole not making a view.</p>

<p>Was Lynmouth, then, to me as it
was?&mdash;not quite. The interval of years
had not, I trust, been lost. If there
was little change in the place, there
was a change in the mind's eye and
head of the sketcher. Though I recognised
nearly all the spots where I
had sketched, I found many new&mdash;some
that might have escaped me,
because I had not taken the feeling
with me, at least not in the degree,
in which I now possessed it. During
all the years that had intervened, I
had scarcely painted a single view.
I could not but observe that the new
scenes were those more especially
suggestive, leading to the ideal.</p>

<p>A friend who was part of the time
with me observed that he had thought
some of my pictures, which he had
seen, compositions without the warranty
of nature; but he now saw that
nature supplied me with what I
wanted, and acknowledged that the
sketches were correct. It was then
I observed that the sketcher may find
almost everywhere what he has learnt
to look for. The fact is, that it is not
whole and large scenery, nor the most
beautiful, that best suits the painter,
but those parts which he can combine.
The real painter looks to nature
for form and colour, the elements of
his art: upon these he must work;
and they seldom reach any great
magnitude, or are diffused over large
space.</p>

<p>Why is it, that generally what we
term beautiful scenery was seldom the
ground of the old painters? They
were not, generally speaking, painters
of views; and why not? There the
pictures were made for them. They,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and all the world had the thing before
them to love and to admire&mdash;it
was already done; there was no room
for their genius, which is a creative,
not an imitative faculty. The scene
for every eye was not theirs. They
found that, by their art, they could
take nature's best feeling, even from
her fragments. It requires not an
Alp to portray grandeur. Fifty feet
of rock, precipitous or superimpending,
will better represent the greatness
of danger; for it is a more immediate
and solid mass to crush the intruder,
and the form may frown with a demon
malice. The whole awe of darkness
may be felt in a cavern of a few feet
space. Indeed, it may be almost said
that largeness is not to be obtained
on the canvass, by the largeness of
whole extensive scenes in nature, but
by the continuous lines of near
masses: whatever is actually largest
in nature&mdash;the forest and the mountain&mdash;in
art may with advantage
occupy the smallest space. For the
best magnitude here is in perspective,
and in that aerial tone which, as a
veil, half conceals, and thereby makes
mysterious, and converts into one
azure whole the parts which would,
otherwise seen, but break up the
great character. The Arabian genii
were greatest when dimly seen through
smoke and vapour.</p>

<p>Art, indeed, differs from nature in
this, as regards the pleasure derived
through the eye, that nature allows you
many unperspective views at many instant
glances, and therefore surprises
you, if I may so express it, with a
perspective impossibility, of which the
judgment at the time is not cognisant;
whereas art is bounded by a rule,
looks not all around, and comprehends
by mind beyond the eye, but is constrained
to frame in the conception.
It must, therefore, make to itself another
power&mdash;and this power it finds
in form, in light and shade, and colour,
all which are in greater intensity
and force in the fragmentary parts
than in the whole and large scenes.
It is a step for the young artist to believe
that art and nature are not and
should not be the same&mdash;that they are
essentially different, and use their
materials differently, have other rules
of space and largeness. If art be
more limited, its power is greater by
being more condensed,&mdash;and its impressions
more certain, because more
direct, and not under the vague and
changeable process of making an idea
from many perspectives.</p>

<p>If there be truth in these remarks,
we may see why the old masters left
untouched those scenes which are the
delight of tourists. To copy the scene
before them was to put their creative
faculty in abeyance. It was only to
work after a given pattern&mdash;and that
pattern imperfect&mdash;of a whole which
defied the laws of optics. I here
speak almost entirely of the Italian
masters, both the historical, and more
strictly the landscape painters. The
Flemish and Dutch schools had mostly
another aim, and were more imitative;
hence they are more easily
understood, but felt with a far less
passion. But even these, far from
undervaluing the conventional aids of
art, applied as much of them as the
nature of their subjects would admit.</p>

<p>But the sketcher must not consider
himself in his studies when he is out
with his portfolio. However he may
select, he must be faithful. And this
fidelity I have seen painters of great
skill often unwisely contemn, become
too conventional, both in their drawing
and colouring. It requires much
practice of the eye, as well as that
knowledge which constitutes taste,
to frame in as it were pictures, from
the large space that fills the eye.
Nothing is more useful than to carry
in the portfolio a light frame of stiff
paper or wood, and to hold it up, so
as actually to frame in pictures, and
thus to experimentalise upon the
design, and see what shiftings of the
frame make the best choice. It is an
assistance even to the most practised
in composition.</p>

<p>Lynmouth is greatly improved of
late years in accommodation; many
new lodging-houses are built, and
there are some residents who have
shown great taste in laying out their
grounds, and in their buildings. The
little pier has been rendered picturesque,
by the erection of a small
look-out house after a model from
Rhodes. There is not much here at
any time that would deserve the
name of shipping; but a few fishing
boats, and such small craft compose
well with the little pier. The evenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
are very fine, the sun setting
over the Channel; and the Welsh
coast in the distance assumes, occasionally,
a very beautiful ultramarine
blue, like a glaze over warm colouring.
When the tide comes in, and
the little vessels are afloat, these are
good subjects, the water being of a
gray green, softening the reflections.
I began a sketch when the boats were
aground; but the tide, coming in
rapidly, soon so altered the position
of the vessels that I did not proceed.
When the tide receded, leaving the
vessels aground, they were not in the
same direction in which I had sketched
them; and an artist who was present
remarked, that the beauty of the
scene as a composition was gone, and
referred to the sketch. This led to
some discussion, as to the cause&mdash;Why
should it be less good now, said he,
than when you drew it? I believe I
saw the reason, and pointed it out.
There was a sloop, larger by much
than all the rest, which were indeed,
though having masts, but boats. The
larger vessel was the principal object,
even more so than the buildings
on the pier, towards which it leaned;
and this leaning was important, for
a union and certain connexion of
parts was everything here, for it made
one of many things. Accordingly,
the smaller boats on each side the
larger vessel inclined their masts
towards it; so that this manifest
uniting, and the belonging of one to
the other, was the pleasing idea,
and invested the whole with a kind
of life and sensitiveness; but in the
alteration, after the receding of the
tide, this communication of the one
with the other was gone, and, on the
contrary, there was left an uncomfortable
feeling of disunion.</p>

<p>This reasoning was admitted, and
we further discussed the principle involved
in the remarks, as applicable
to all scenes and subjects. It is this
correspondence of part with part
which animates the works of nature,
invests them with an ideal sensitiveness;
and through this fond belief of
their life, our own sensitiveness is
awakened to a sympathy with them.
Whatever inanimate objects we in
our fancy invest with life, through
our own sympathy, we clothe with a
kind of humanity; and thus we look
on trees and rocks, and water, as to a
degree our fellow creatures, in this
great wild world. We love accordingly.
<i>Nihil humanum a me alienum
puto.</i> The very winds speak to us
as human voices, as do the trees in
their whisperings or complainings;
and the waters are ever repeating
their histories and their romances to
our willing ears. As we walked we
tested the principle, and were believers
in its truth. "Mark," said our
friend, "that bank of fern&mdash;how
graceful, how charming, is their bending,
their interchange, their masses
and their hollow shades, their little
home-depths, wherein they grow,
and retire as their home-chambers:
there is throughout the pleasing idea
of a family enjoying their quiet existence,
and all in one small green
world of their own." He enjoys
nature most worthily, and most intensely,
who carries with him this
sense of nature's life, and of a mutuality,
a co-partnership with the
blessings of existence with himself.
There are some fine rocks at the base
of the precipitous cliffs&mdash;of fine form
and colour; I never went sufficiently
near to sketch them, having no fancy
to be caught by the tide. I have
seen sketches made amongst them
that prove them to afford very good
subjects. Many years ago, while sitting
under these cliffs, I heard a
groan; I thought at the time it must
have been a delusion, but on that
evening a man had fallen over the
cliffs. His body was, I think, found
the next day. It fell from Countesbury
Hill, the road on which is
certainly not sufficiently protected.
And this reminds me to speak of
an alarming occurrence on the road,
about half a mile from Lynmouth.
We were a small party, and had
taken shelter from rain against the
receding part of the rocks cut for
the widening the road. I and
another were reading a newspaper.
Looking up, we suddenly saw a woman
on horseback very near us. The
animal started, and was frightened at
the newspaper. Our endeavour to
conceal it made the matter worse; the
horse retreated from us, and I think
his hind legs could not have been
many inches from the precipice. It
was a trying moment; one step more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
back would have been certain death to
both the woman and the horse. We
were truly happy when, by a little
management, we contrived to get
them past us. The road, too, is in
these dangerous places very narrow;
yet the people venture to drive at a
good pace, and without reins, their
uncouth and apparently unmanageable
teams&mdash;neither quite dray nor
cart&mdash;fearlessly. It is surprising that
accidents do not often occur, especially
as there is some danger from the
falling of masses of stone from above;
and even such as the sheep remove
with their feet may frighten horses,
and precipitate all to sure destruction.
There are great rents in huge masses
of rock, close to the road, and some
apparently are kept firm with but
little earth, and seem to threaten a
move. I have had some blows on the
back occasionally from small stones,
cast down by passing sheep, while I
have been sketching down by the
water; and once so large a one took
the corner of my portfolio, that with
my best speed I quitted the place.
That was some years ago; but I have
recently seen not very small fragments
fall very near me. I would, therefore,
caution the sketcher to choose as
safe a position as he can, which he
may generally find under some projection
of rock. Some of the masses
in the bed of the river are of enormous
size; and let me here remark upon
the fine, bold character these masses
in the river possess&mdash;they are very
fine in form, and the beauty and
variety in their colouring are quite
wondrous. Some are very dark, entirely
covered with brown, and some
with, bright golden moss. But most
of them when dry are gray&mdash;but one
name will not describe that gray,
varying as it does from the blue to the
green and pink hues. They are commonly
in bold relief against the dark
water&mdash;yet themselves show dark,
edged by the white foam, where the
water, sloping insinuatingly, falls and
rushes by them. Here and there, in
some deep-shaded, wild, lonely places,
they are of gigantic size, and look
like huge Titans turned to stone, amid
the fragments that had hurled them
down. The sketcher may easily
imagine himself in the territory of
magic. Shall I confess that, in such
places, I do not like to sketch alone?
And why not? Why should there be
a something like a superstitious awe
of the spot, the "<i>severi religio loci</i>?"</p>

<p>Doubtless it is because we do feel
contradicting knowledge, in this consciousness
of all nature in its own life
and power. Nor can we divest ourselves
of a kind of natural poetry&mdash;a
feeling that the rocks, the wild trees,
and the somewhere though unseen
"<i>genius loci</i>" all look at us, and we
fancy ourselves but under sufferance,
and know not how long our presence
may be endured. It is surprising how
a sense of such presences possesses
us when alone. I could often have
fancied voices, and mocking ones too,
in the waters, and threats that thundered
in the ear, and went off as if to
fetch and bring whole cataracts down
upon me. In such places I do not
like to be caught by the dusk of the
evening, being quite alone.</p>

<p>The fact is, nature, to a real lover
and sketcher, is at all times powerful.
Scenes affect him as they affect no
other. I have often surprised people
by the assertion that I could not live
in the midst of fine scenery; it is too
powerful, it unnerves one with an
unrelaxing watchfulness. The presence
of the mountain will not be
shaken off. It becomes a nightmare
upon the spirits, holds communion
with the wild winds and storms, and
has fearful dealings I would not dream
of in the dark, howling, dismal nights.
Nor, when the sombre light of a melancholy
day just obscures the clouds that
have been gathering round it, would
I in imagination draw the curtain to
behold the unearthly drama.</p>

<p>There is something terrific in the
sound of unseen rushing water. When
all else is still in the dark night, and
you are uncertain of the path, and
feel the danger that a false footing
may plunge you into an abyss of
waters, that seem to cry out and roar
for a victim, have you not felt both
fear and shame? Recently I experienced
this in Lynmouth, having in
the darkness lost my way. To the
poet and the painter, here is a source
of the sublime. Plunge your pencil
boldly into this eclipse, and work
into it a few dim lights formless and
undefined&mdash;the obscure will be of a
grand mystery. The night-darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
that settles over fine mountainous
scenery does not remove the sense of
its presence; as its lakes blacken,
they become fabulous, of unknown
depths, below which may be infernal
"bolge." But I am wandering into
strange regions now, and far from
Lynmouth, whose scenes, after all,
are not of a very severe beauty, unless
we will to make it so. It will then
answer the demand imagination makes
upon it. Many are the scenes of a
purely quiescent kind, still and calm,
and of gentle repose, where the shallow
river shows its amber bed, wherein
the gleams rest upon the well-defined
ledges beneath, whose gray
shadows melt into golden tints; and
beyond, in the deeper pools, the green
of the trees is reflected greener still,
across which here and there is a gray
streak, showing the river's silent onward
movement; and further on, some
dark stones send their brown and
purple hues, mirrored and softened
down into the green, just dotted here
and there with white. Then the trees
shoot out lovingly from the bank overhead,
and reach and communicate
pleasantly with those on the opposite
side; and here a bough sends down
and just forbears to touch the stream,
Narcissus-like, loving its own image.
The gray stones in the foreground,
half beneath the water, are of a delicate
hue, blue intermingling with pale
greenish and lakey tints; for there is
nothing violent in all this scene of
peaceful repose. Very many spots of
this kind are there that court the
sketcher. Let him wind his way over
masses of stone, and roots of trees,
beyond these&mdash;the scene how changed!
The masses of stone are huge,
blocking up, in various positions, the
free passage of the river, which chafes
and foams between them, throwing
off its whiteness into the brown and
green water depths. One broad shadow
is over the dark stones; and beyond
that rise the tops of other
masses, gray illuminated; and beyond
them, a gleam or two of falling water.
Wilder are the trees that shoot out,
from rocky fragments near, and lock
their branches with those on the other
side; while in the hollow space beneath
their arching boles, distant and
fantastic stems cross the stream.
Opposite are huge masses, ledges
with precipitous and brown-mossed
sides; above which the high rocky
bank sends forth large trees, their
roots twisting about the rocks and
coming out again through the fissures,
and met by green weed leafage. The
trees are darker than the dun-red
ground, but edged with greenish light;
and above them the yellow sunlight
gleams through, and the dotted blue
of sky is just seen; and, as avoiding
the light, a huge branch, or limb
rather, shoots down, edged with the
light on its upper surface, and dark
underneath, and throws a scanty defined
leafage across over the depth of
the river. But this precipitous bank
again terminates towards the ledges
in fine masses, rocks that project and
recede, partially luminous with reflected
light, and then falling back
into extreme brown and purple darkness,
down into which the ivy falls
clustering and perpendicular, with innumerable
briar-like shoots and tendrils.
Here are severer studies.
They are to be found by crossing the
Lyn by the wooden bridge, not far
from Lynmouth, and following the
path through the wood some way,
and seeking the bed of the river by a
scarcely-discernible sheep-path, till
it be lost at the edge of a downward
way, not very difficult of descent.
Within a very small space, there are
fine and very different subjects. One
of scarcely less grandeur than the
last described, if it had not more
beauty blended with it; but it
must be seen in the sun's eye&mdash;the
best time will be about 3 o'clock.
Reach a large stone that juts out from
the river's side, climb it, and look
down the stream. You must sketch
rapidly, for the charm will not last&mdash;it
is most lovely in colour, and the forms
are very beautiful. The opposite side
of the river may be termed a mountain
side, broken into hollows, in which
rock and vegetation deepen into shade.
The top is covered with trees, very
graceful, the sun edges their tops, and
rays flow through them, touching with
a white and silver light the ivied rock,
which is here perpendicular. Beyond
this mountain-side, which juts out, is
another clothed cliff, terminating at
the base in bold and bare rock; beyond
this, and high above, shooting
into the sky, are piled rocks of a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
and broken character, gray, but dark
against the distant mountain range, of
an ultramarine haze, over warm and
slightly marked downward passages;
above is the illumined and illuminating
sky. On the side of the river from
which this lovely view is seen, are
large masses, backed by trees, which
shoot across, but high overhead, so
that in the sketch the leafage would
drop as it were from the sky into the
middle of the picture. The river itself
is quite accordant in colour, and in the
forms and light and shade of the
stones, that, though so large, are
dwarfed by the large precipitous rocks
perpendicular above them. The course
of the stream is away from the eye of
the spectator&mdash;is in parts darkly transparent
and deep&mdash;here and there
showing the white foam, and in other
parts its amber and reddish bed.</p>

<p>A little further back from this point
of view is another of the same scene;
I am doubtful which would make the
best picture. On the very same stone
from which I sketched the scene described,
turning with my back to the
opposite side of the river, I was much
struck with the fine forms and solemn
light and shade of a rock, that was
cavernously hollow at its base, and
very near the stream. Above it, and
declining into the middle of the picture,
the sunlit boles of coppice-trees,
rising among the light-green leafage,
made the only positive sunlight of
the picture: whatever else of light
there was, was shade luminous. This
rock was united with another across
the picture, that thus made a centre
and opening for the coppice, dotted
with the blue sky; but all that side of
the picture was in very dark shadow,
being rock perpendicular, through the
depth of which light and boldly formed
trees rose to the top of the picture, and
threw down leafage into the deep
shade. The colouring of the cavernous
hollow was remarkable: it was dark,
yet blending gray, and pink, and green.
The scene was of an ideal character;
and I doubt if the sketch, though
taken with as much truth as I could
reach, would be thought to be from
nature. The same rocky mass, taken
in another direction, supplies a very
different but perhaps equally good
subject for the pencil. I say these
sketches are of an ideal kind. It may be
asked&mdash;Are they not true?&mdash;are they
not in nature? They are; but still for
a better use than the pleasure of the
imitation a mere sketch offers. These
are the kinds of scenes for the painter's
invention, into which he is to throw
his mind, and to dip his pencil freely
into the gloom of his palette, and concentrate
depths, and even change the
forms, and even to omit much of the
decorative detail, and make severity
severer. He would give the little trees
a wilder life, a more visible power, as
if for lack of inhabitant they only were
sentient of the scene. If a figure be
introduced, they would be kept down,
but shoot their branches towards him,
for there would be an agreement, a
sentient sympathy. But what figure?
It is not peaceful enough for a hermit;
too solemn for the bandit, such as
Salvator would love to introduce; an
early saint, perhaps a St Jerome&mdash;no
unapt place for him and his lion: and
somehow it must be contrived to have
the water perhaps entering even into
the retreat, and reflecting the aged,
the hoary bearded saint. Is not then
the subject ideal, and the sketch only
suggestive? And here let me remark,
with regard to that favourite word
"finish,"&mdash;an elaborate finish of <i>all</i>
the detail, either of objects or colouring,
would ruin the sketch; it would
lose its suggestive character, which is
its value. I have here described, I
know how inadequately, several very
striking scenes; yet are they scarcely
a stone's throw apart. I mention them
exclusively on that account, for, where
there is so much, it must be the more
worth the while of the sketcher to
take some pains to find out the spot.</p>

<p>What do we mean by the "ideal"
of landscape? The "naturalists"
ask the question in a tone of somewhat
more than doubt. The sketcher is apt
to be caught in the snare of nature's
many beauties, and, growing enamoured
of them in detail, to lose the higher
sense in his practical imitation. This
is a danger he must avoid, by study,
by reflection, by poetry. If the "ideal"
be in himself, he will find it in nature.
If he sees in mountains, woods, and
fields but materials for the use of man,
and what the toil of man has made
them, he may be a good workman
in his imitation, but he will be a poor
designer. The "ideal" grows out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
a reverence, which he can scarcely
feel. If the earth be nothing to him
but for the plough, and the rivers for
the mill, and its only people are the
present people&mdash;doomed to toil, bearing
about them parochial cares, and
tasteless necessity, ignorant and regardless
of the history of the earth
they tread&mdash;he may boast of his love
of nature; but his love is, in fact, the
love of his technical skill, of his imitation.
He thinks more of the how
to represent, than what the scene may
represent. The ideal ranges beyond
the present aspect, and he who has a
belief in it will reverence this ancient
earth, the cradle wherein he and all
living things took form from their
creation. He will see visions of the
past, and dream dreams of its future
aspects and destiny; and will learn, in
his meditations, to recall the people of
old, and imprint its soil with imaginary
footsteps. The painter is no true
artist if he feel not the greatness of
nature's immortality&mdash;at least, that as
it rose from the creation so will it be,
throwing forth its bounty, and beaming
with the same vigorous beauty,
till it shall pass away as a scroll. The
painter-poet must be of a loving superstition,
must acknowledge powers
above his own&mdash;beings greater between
him and the heavens. They may be
invisible as angels, yet leave some understanding
of their presence. They
will voice the woods and the winds,
and tell everywhere that all of nature
is life. Are there not noble elements
here for the landscape painter, and
can neither history nor fable supply
him with better figures than toil-worn
labourers, drovers taking their cattle
or sheep to the butchers, and paupers
walking the poorhouse? I like not
the "naturalist's" poverty of thought.
If the art be not twin sister with poetry,
her charm is only for the eye. Nothing
great ever came from such hands.</p>

<p>How do such thoughts enhance all
nature's beauties! The sketcher's
real work is to see, to feel them all,
and to fit them to the mind's poetic
thoughts.</p>

<p>I seem to be forgetting that the
reader and myself are all this while at
the water's edge, and under deep-brow'd
rocks; that sunshine has left
us, and it is time to climb to the
path that leads toward Lynmouth.
For such an hour we are on the wrong
side of the stream. Now the woods
are mapped, and edged only by the sun
hastening downward. Yet after awhile
we shall not regret that we are in this
path. Escaping the closer and shaded
wood, we shall reach a more open
space, and see the flood of evening's
sunlight pouring in. Here it is; my
sketch was poor indeed, for there was
neither time nor means to do anything
like justice to the scene. Here is a
narrow, winding rocky path, a little
above the river, from whose superimpending
bank, trees that now look
large shoot across the landscape, and
a bold stem or two rises up boldly to
meet them; the river stretches to
some distance, wooded on this side to
the edge, and wooded hills in front,
and in perspective. The distant hills
are most lovely in colour, pearly and
warm gray; the river, the blazing
sky reflected, yet showing how rich
the tone, by a few yellowish-gray
lighter streaks that mark its movement.
The fragments of rock in the
river are of a pinkish-gray, and,
though not dark, yet strongly marked
against the golden stream,&mdash;the whole
scene great in its simplicity of effect
and design. In broad day the scene
would be passed unnoticed; it would
want that simplicity which is its
charm, and be a scene of detail; but
now the lines are the simplest, and,
happily, where the river really turns,
its view is lost in the reflection of the
shaded wood. And here, in this
smallest portion of the picture, the
hills on each side seem to meet and
fold, giving the variety in the smallest
space, upon which I have made remarks
in this paper. This beautiful
picture of nature I visited several
evenings, and it little varied. But the
charm lasts not long&mdash;the sun sets, or
is behind the wooded hill, before its
actual setting, yet leaves its tinge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
lake blushing above the gold in the
sky&mdash;the life of the scene has faded,
and it is still and solemn. I cannot
better describe the impression it left,
than by a quotation from an old play,
in which the lover sees his mistress,
who had swooned, or was in a deathlike
sleep:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Antonio.</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At the first sight I did believe her dead&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in that state so awful she appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I approached her with as much respect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the soul had animated still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That body which, though dead, scarce mortal seemed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the sun from our horizon gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beams do leave a tincture on the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shows it was not long since he withdrew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in her lovely face there still appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some scattered streaks of those vermilion beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which used t'irradiate that bright firmament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus did I find that distressed miracle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Able to wound a heart, as if alive&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incapable to cure it, as if dead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus is there sympathy between our
hearts and nature&mdash;a sympathy, the
secret of taste, which, above all, the
sketcher should cultivate as the
source of his pleasure, and (may it
not be added?) of his improvement.</p>

<p>I will not proceed further with
description of scenes; Lynmouth will
be long remembered. I scarcely know
a better spot for the study of close
scenery. On reviewing my former
impressions with the present, I should
not say that Lynmouth has lost, but
I have certainly gained some knowledge,
and, I think, improved my
sympathies with nature; and if I have
not enjoyed so enthusiastically as I
did sixteen years ago, I have enlarged
my sight and extended my power. I
am practically a better sketcher. The
hand and the eye, work together; the
improvement of one advances the
other.</p>

<p>I know no better method of sketching
than the mixture of transparent
and semi-opaque colouring. It best
represents the variety and the power
of nature; and as it more nearly
resembles in its working the practice
of oil-painting, so is it the more
likely to improve the painter. I
have remarked that, even in depth of
colour, the semi-opaque is very much
more powerful than the transparent,
however rich; for the one has, besides
its more varied colour, the
solidity of nature; whereas the most
transparent has ever an unsubstantial
look&mdash;you see through to the paper or
the canvass. Semi-opaque, (or degrees
of opacity, till it borders on the
transparent,) as it hides the material,
and throws into every part the charm
of atmosphere, so it will ever bestow
upon the sketch the gift of truth.</p>

<p>I did not begin this paper on Lynmouth
Revisited with any intention
of entering upon the technicalities of
art; so I will refrain from any
further remarks tending that way,
which leads to far too wide a field for
present discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_HAS_REVOLUTIONISING_GERMANY_ATTAINED" id="WHAT_HAS_REVOLUTIONISING_GERMANY_ATTAINED">WHAT HAS REVOLUTIONISING GERMANY ATTAINED?</a></h2>


<p>It is now rather more than a year
since we asked, "What would revolutionising
Germany be at?" A full
year has passed over the dreamy,
theorising, restless, and excited head
of Germany, then confused and staggering,
like "a giant drunken with
new wine," but loudly vaunting that
its strong dose of revolution had
strengthened and not fuddled it, and
that it was about to work out of its
troubled brains a wondrous system of
German Unity, which was to bring it
infinite and permanent happiness; and
now we would once more ask, What
is the result of the attempted application
of German revolutionising theory
to practice? In fact, what has revolutionising
Germany attained? Our
first question we asked without being
able to resolve an answer. The problem
was stated: an attempt was
made to arrive at something like a
solution out of the distracting hurly-burly
of supposed purposes and so-called
intentions; but, after every
effort to make out our "sum" in any
reasonable manner, we were obliged
to give it up, as a task impossible to
any political mathematician, not of
German mould; to declare any definite
solution for the present hopeless,&mdash;and
to end our amount of calculation
by arriving only in a <i>cercle vicieux</i> at
the statement of the problem with
which we started, and asking, as despairingly
as a tired schoolboy with
a seemingly impracticable equation
before him, "What, indeed, <i>would</i>
revolutionising Germany be at?" Are
we any further advanced now? We
will not attempt the difficult sum
again, or we might find ourselves
obliged to avow ourselves as much
deficient in the study of German political
mathematics as before. But we
may at least try to undertake a mere
sum of addition, endeavour to cast up
the amount of figures the Germans
themselves have laid before us, and
make out, as well as we can, what,
after a year's hard&mdash;and how hard!&mdash;work,
revolutionising Germany has
attained. The species of sum-total,
as far as the addition can yet go, to
which we may arrive, may be still a
very confused and unsatisfactory one;
but in asking, "What has revolutionising
Germany attained?" we will not
take it entirely to our own charge, if
the answer attempted to be made is
thus confused and unsatisfactory.
German political sums are all too
puzzling for English heads.</p>

<p>Last year Germany was, as yet,
very young in its revolutionary career.
It galloped over the country like an
unbroken colt, or rather like a mad
bull, "running a-muck" it scarcely
knew, and seemingly little cared, at
what, provided that it trampled beneath
its hoofs all that stood, and, with
proper culture, might have flourished
and borne fruit. It tried to imitate
the frantic caperings of its fellow-revolutioniser
in the next paddock,
just over the Rhine; but it imitated
this model in so clumsy a fashion, that
it might have been very aptly compared
to the ass in the fable, had not
the demonstrations it sought to make
been destructive kicks, and not mistaken
caresses; and the model it
sought to copy resembled the bloodhound
rather than the lap-dog. It
kicked out to the right and to the left,
and, with its kicks, inflicted several
stunning blows, from which the other
states, upon whose heads the kicks fell,
found some difficulty in recovering.
Even the maddest of the drivers who
spurred it on, however, found it necessary
to present some goal, at which it
was eventually to arrive in its mad
career&mdash;that goal was called "German
Unity" in one great powerful
united Germany. Where this visionary
goal existed, or how it was to be
attained&mdash;by what path, or in what
direction, none seemed to know; but
the cry was, "On, on, on!" That it
should miss this goal, thus visionary
and indistinct, and plunge on past it,
through the darkness of anarchy, to
another winning-post, just as indistinct
and visionary, called "a universal
republic," was a matter of little
consideration, or was even one of hope,
to those of its principal drivers who
whipped, and spurred, and hooted it,
with deafening and distracting cries,
like the Roman drivers of the unridden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
horses in the Corso races. A
breaker-in was attempted, however,
to be placed, and not, at first, precisely
by those who most wished to
check it, upon the back of the tearing
beast, in order to moderate its paces,
and canter it as gently as might be,
onwards to the denied goal&mdash;which
still, however, lay only in a most misty
distance, to which none seemed to
know the road. In this rider, called
a central Frankfort parliament, men
began to place their hopes, they
trusted confidently that it might ride
the animal to its destination, although
they knew not where that lay. The
revolution, then, was decked out with
colours of red, and black, and gold&mdash;the
colours of an old German empire,
and of a new derived German unity&mdash;and
the rider mounted into the saddle.
How the rider endeavoured to show
the animal's paces&mdash;how he strove to
guide him forwards&mdash;how sometimes
he seemed, indeed, to be proceeding
along a path, uncertain, it is true, but
apparently leading <i>somewhere</i>&mdash;how
often he stumbled&mdash;how often, in his
inexperience, he slipped in his saddle&mdash;how,
at last, he slipped and fell from
it altogether, in vain endeavouring,
maimed, mutilated, bruised, and half
stunned, to spring into the saddle
again, are matters of newspaper history
that need no detail here. It
suffices to say, that the rider was unhorsed&mdash;that
the animal gave a last
desperate plunge, kicking and wounding
the only one of the states around
that strove to the last to caress and
soothe it with gentle treatment&mdash;that
it now stands perspiring, shaking,
quivering in every limb&mdash;snorting
in vain struggle, and champing the
bit of the bridle which Prussian military
force has thrown upon it. To
what, then, has Germany attained in
its revolutionising career? It has,
at all events, not reached that imaginary
goal to which men strove to
ride it without direction-post. The
goal is as far off as ever, perhaps
farther off than before, as may be
shown. It remains just as vague, and
visionary, and misty. Not one step
seems to have been taken towards it.
Has no farther step whatever been
taken, then, after all this mad rushing
hither and thither? And if any, how,
and whither? We shall endeavour to
see, as far as we are able. Our readers
must, then, judge whether it be forwards
or backwards, or whether, in
fact, it be any step at all.</p>

<p>The Frankfort parliament has fallen
from its seat. Last year, when we
gave a sketch of its sittings in that
Lutheran church of St Paul in Frankfort&mdash;now
bearing a stamp which
its sober-minded architect probably
never dreamt of, as a historical building&mdash;it
was young, still in hopes;
and amidst its inexperience, its vapouring
declamation upon impracticable
theories, its noise and confusion, its
clamorous radicalism, and its internal
treachery, that sought every pretext for
exciting to anarchy and insurrection, it
put forward men of note and ability&mdash;who,
however lacking in practical experience,
gave evidence of noble hearts,
if not sound heads, and good intentions,
if not governmental power. It contained,
amidst much bad, many elements
of good; and, if it has no other
advantageous result, it has proved a
school of experience, tact, and reason&mdash;as
far at least as Germans, in the present
condition of their political education,
have been able to profit by its
lessons and its teaching. <i>De mortuis
nil nisi bonum</i> as far as possible! It
is defunct. What its own inability,
want of judgment, internal disorganisation,
and "vaulting ambition, that
o'erleaps its sell," commenced, was
completed by the refusal of the principal
northern German states to acknowledge
its ill-digested constitution.
It sickened upon over-feeding of conceit,
excess of supposed authority, and a
naturally weak constitution, combined
with organic defects, weakened still
more by a perpetual and distracting
fever; it was killed outright by what
the liberals, as well as the democrats,
of Germany choose to call the ill
faith and treachery of Prussia in declining
to accept its offers, and ultimately
refusing to listen to its dictates.
Its dying convulsions were
frightful. It fled to Stutgardt, in the
hopes that change of air might save it
in its last extremity: and there it
breathed its last. Its very home is a
wreck; its furniture has been sold to
pay the expenses of its burial; its
lucubrations, and its mighty acts, in
which it once fondly hoped to have
swayed all Germany, if not the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
have been dispersed, in their recorded
form, among cheesemongers and greengrocers
as waste-paper, at so much the
pound. Its house&mdash;the silent, sad, and
denuded church of St Paul&mdash;looks now
like its only mausoleum; and on its
walls remains alive the allegorical picture
of that great German empire,
which it deemed it had but to will to
found&mdash;the grim, dark, shaded face of
which grows grimmer and darker still,
day by day; whilst the sun that rises
behind it, without illuminating its
form, daily receives its thicker and
thicker cloud of dust to obscure its
painted rays. Of a sooth, the allegory
is complete. It is dead, and resolved
to ashes. Its better and brighter elements
have given up their last breath,
as, in their meeting at Gotha, they
made a last effort to discuss the acceptance
of the constitution which
Prussia offered in lieu of their own,
and strove, although only still wearing
a most ghostly semblance of life,
to propose to themselves the best ultimate
means of securing that desideratum,
which they still seem to consider
as the panacea for all evils&mdash;the
great and powerful "United Germany"
of their theoretical dreams.
This last breath was not without its
noble aspirations. Its less pure, more
self-seeking, and darker elements have
striven, by wild and no longer (even
in appearance) legal means, to galvanise
themselves into a false existence;
their last struggles were such hideous
and distracted contortions as are usually
produced by such galvanic applications;
and now the German papers
daily record the arrest of various
members of the so-called "Rump
Parliament," (so nicknamed by the
application or rather misapplication of
an English historical term,) which received
its final extinguishing blow at
Stutgardt, mixed up, in these days of
imprisonment, as the consequence of
mistaken liberty, along with insurgents
and rebels engaged in the late
disastrous scenes acted in the duchy
of Baden. Such was to be <i>their</i> fate.
But, be it for good or for evil, the
Frankfort parliament has died, as was
prophesied, and not without convulsions:
its purposes have proved null;
its hopes have been dispersed to the
winds; its very traces have been
swept away; its memory is all but a
bitter mockery. Thus far, then, we
may indeed shake our heads despairingly
as we ask&mdash;"What has
revolutionising Germany as yet attained?"</p>

<p>What has it attained? Let as go
on. In the first place, what remains
of the gigantic cloud, which men
attempted to catch, embody, and
model into a palpable form, although
with hands inexperienced, and with
as little of the creative and vivifying
health really within its power, as
Frankenstein, when he sought to
remould the crumbling elements he
possessed into a human form, and
produced a monster. What remains
of the great united German empire
of men's dreams? Nothing but a
phantom of a central power, grasping
the powerless sceptre of a ghostly
empire; surrounded by ministers
whose dictates men despise and disregard,
in veritable exercise of their
functions, as ghostly as itself. The
position of the Imperial administration
has become a byword and a
scoff; and it is lamentable to see a
prince, whose good intentions never
have been doubted, and whose popular
sympathies have been so often
shown, standing thus, in a situation
which borders upon the ridiculous&mdash;an
almost disregarded and now useless
puppet&mdash;a <i>quasi</i> emperor without
even the shadow of an empire; and
yet condemned to play at empire-administrating&mdash;as
children play at
kings and queens&mdash;none heeding their
innocent and bootless game. How
far the edicts of the defunct Frankfort
parliament, and the decrees of
the government of the Imperial Vicarage&mdash;paralysed
in all real strength, if
not utterly defunct now&mdash;are held as
a public mockery, is very pithily evidenced
to the least open eyes of any
traveller to the baths of Germany,
at most of which the gambling tables&mdash;supposed
to be suppressed, and
declared to be illegal by the shade of
the "central power,"&mdash;openly pursue
their man&oelig;uvres, and earn their gains
as of yore; or, at most, fix upon the
doors of their hells a ticket, written
"<i>salons reserv&eacute;s</i>," to give them the
faint appearance of private establishments,
and thus adopt a very flimsy
pretext, and effect a most barefaced
evasion of a hitherto useless law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
<i>Croupiers</i> and gamblers sit squatting,
most disrespectfully, at almost every
bathing-place, upon the Imperial edict&mdash;as
the toads and frogs squatted
upon King Log&mdash;treating him as a
jest, and covering him with their
filthy slime. By what authority&mdash;of
the same Imperial Vicar also&mdash;the
whole country around Frankfort is
overrun with Prussian soldiers, it
would be difficult to show. That the
so-called free city itself should be
occupied by a joint garrison of Prussian
and Austrian troops for its
protection, may be looked upon as
a legal measure, adopted and authorised
by a new parliament, and a
central power, such as it is, as by
the old Diet. But when we see
in every village round about&mdash;in
every house, in almost every hovel&mdash;those
hosts of Prussian spiked
helmets gleaming in the sun&mdash;those
Prussian bayonets planted before
every door&mdash;those Prussian uniforms,
studding, with variegated colour,
every green rural scene; when we
never cease to hear upon the breeze&mdash;wherever
we may wander in the
country&mdash;the clang of Prussian military
bands, and the tramp of Prussian
infantry; when we find the faces of
Prussian military at every window,
and observe Prussian soldiers mixing
in every action of the common everyday
life of the country; and then
turn to ask how it comes that Prussian
soldiers swarm throughout a
part of the land in no way belonging
to Prussia, we are able to receive no
more reasonable answer than that
"they are there because they are
there"&mdash;an explanation which has a
more significant meaning in it than
the apparently senseless words seem
to express. "They are there because
they are there"&mdash;that is to say, without
any recognised authority from any central
German power. "They are there
because they are there,"&mdash;because
Prussia has sent them. Where, then,
is the central power?&mdash;what is its
force? what its authority? what its
sense? If, then, all that still remains,
in living form, of that great united
Germany of men's dreams, is but the
"shadow of a shade," in power&mdash;a
power disregarded&mdash;even more, despised
and ridiculed&mdash;what has revolutionising
Germany attained in its
chase after the phantom of its
hopes?</p>

<p>If in this respect it has <i>attained</i>
nothing which it can show, after
more than a year's revolution, for the
avowed or pretended purpose of obtaining
some result to this very end,
it cannot be said, however, that nothing
remains to Germany of its
dream of unity. Spite of sad experience&mdash;spite
of the uselessness of
every effort&mdash;spite of sacrifices made
and sorrows suffered&mdash;Germany still
pursues its phantom with as much
ardour as before. Like the prince in
the fairy-tale, who, panting, breathless,
half-dead with exhaustion and
fatigue, still hunted without rest for
the imaginary original of the fair portrait
placed in his hands&mdash;untired
and unyielding, after the repeated
disappointments of lifting veil after
veil from forms which he thought
might be that of the beloved one&mdash;still
driven on by an incurable longing&mdash;still
yearning despairingly, and with
false hope,&mdash;so does Germany, after
lifting veil after veil only to find delusive
spectres beneath, still yearn
and long for the object of its adoration.
It is impossible to travel, even
partially, through the country, without
discovering, from every conversation
with all classes, that the intense
craving for this object&mdash;this great
blessing of a grand and powerful
United Germany&mdash;is as strong as
ever&mdash;far stronger than ever! For
what was not very long ago only the
watchword of the fancied liberal student,
in his play of would-be conspirator&mdash;what
was but the pretext of
really conspiring and subversive democrats&mdash;what
grew only by degrees
into the cry of the people, who
clamoured, not knowing what they
clamoured for&mdash;has taken evidently
the strongest root throughout the
whole mass of German nationality,
and <i>grows</i>&mdash;grows in despite of the
rottenness of the branches it has as
yet sent forth&mdash;grows in despite of
the lopping, breaking, and burning of
its first offshoots&mdash;grows in despite of
the atmosphere of contention, rather
than of union, that becomes thicker
and more deleterious to its growth,
around it, and of the blight it daily
receives from the seemingly undispersable
mildew of hatred, suspicion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
and total want of sympathy between
Southern and Northern Germany,
which formerly arose only from uncongeniality
of temperament, mixed
up more or less with difference of
religious creed, but now is generated
by a thousand causes. This intense
craving for the possession of the
phantom&mdash;increasing, it would seem,
in proportion as the phantom flies
farther and farther from the grasp&mdash;is
no longer expressed by the student,
the democrat, and the man of the
people: it pervades all classes from
below to above; it is in the mouth of
the man of caution and of sense, as in
that of the wild and poetico-political
enthusiast; it becomes more and
more universal, and it amounts to a
mania. Ask of whom you will, "Whither
tends German hope?" and the answer
will still and ever be the same&mdash;"German
unity." But ask no more;
for if you inquire, as last year, into
the "how," the "when," the "where,"
the answer will in most cases be given
in the same strain of incomprehensible
and still more impracticable rhapsody&mdash;visionary,
poetical, noble sometimes,
but purposeless as before; or
men will shrug their shoulders, shake
their heads, and sigh, but still dream
on the dream of German unity&mdash;still
clamour for it loudly. And well may
they shake their heads and groan, if
such be the end and aim of all German
aspirations! for where, indeed,
is the pith that leads to it? That
which Germany is itself following up,
leads (for the present at least) visibly
from it, and not towards it. Prussia
has promulgated its constitution,&mdash;and
we may ask, <i>par parenth&egrave;se</i>,
whether <i>that</i> is to be put forward as
the great end which revolutionising
Germany has attained, after more
than a year's revolution? Prussia
has called upon all Germany to join
with it, hand in hand, in this constitution,
granted and given, but not
accepted, at the hands of a Frankfort
parliament. In answer to its
call, it has found the cleft between
Northern and Southern Germany&mdash;the
cleft, of envy and jealousy, suspicion
and mistrust&mdash;growing wider and
wider to oppose it. It has attempted
to form a partial union of Northern
Germany&mdash;between the more northern
states of Prussia, Hanover, and
Saxony; but even in this union has
been disunion&mdash;reticence, and suspicion,
and doubt, and indecision, among
the proposed allies themselves; while
Austria, Bavaria, and even Wurtemberg,
have held aloof to sulk and
scoff, and have seemed to bide that
time when Austria should be less
shackled, and could better oppose the
supremacy of Northern German influence.
Coalitions even now are
talked of, to which, if Prussia be not
a stranger, it is to be admitted only
as a humbled ally. With these feelings,
which exist not only between
powers, but in the people, the cry of
United Germany is but a jest&mdash;the
longing a green-sickness. Certainly
revolutionising Germany has not thus
far attained any step in its progress
towards the great desideratum of its
nationality. The only semblance of
progress has been, in the advances of
Prussia towards supremacy, in the
cession of the principality of Hohenzollern
Sigmaringen to its territory,
(an example which other small German
principalities may follow,) in its
present occupation of the free town of
Hamburg, in its military occupation
of the duchy of Baden, of which
more further on. But if these be
steps towards a united Germany, tell
it to Southern Germany, and hear
what it will say!</p>

<p>If so little, then, has been attained
by revolutionising Germany, in its
progress towards its most loudly
clamoured desire, let us see what
else it has attained. After a year's
labour, which was not without its
throes, revolutionising Germany, as
represented by its central parliament,
brought forth its constitution&mdash;a
rickety child, but fully expected by
its fond, and in many respects infatuated
parents, to grow into a giant,
and flourish under the edifice of a
United German Empire. The implicit
adoption of this bantling by
the several German states, as their
heir and future master, was declared
by revolutionisers to be the <i>sine qu&acirc;
non</i> of their sufferance still to exist
at all, under the will of the people.
Unhappy bantling, decked out with
all sorts of promised gifts for the
future weal of mankind by its would-be
fairy godmothers! it proved but a
changeling&mdash;or rather an imp, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
with every curse, instead of
every blessing; as if the gifts it was
intended to bestow had been reversed
by a wicked fairy among the godmothers,
who had more power than
the rest. And, of a truth, there was
such a one among them: and her
name was Anarchy or Subversion, although
the title she gave herself was
Red Republic, and the beast on which
she rode was Self-interest. The consequence
was, that the very contrary
occurred to that which revolutionisers
had prophesied or rather menaced.
Prussia, and the other states, which
refused to adopt the bantling, thus
menacingly thrown into their arms,
have gone on, we cannot say the
"even," but uneven "tenor of their
way"&mdash;no matter now by what means,
for we speak only of the strange
destinies of the much-laboured, long-expected,
loudly-vaunted Frankfort
constitution. Almost the only one&mdash;at
least of the larger states the only
one&mdash;that seemingly accepted the
adoption forced upon it, with frankness,
willingness, and openness, has
been convulsed by the most terrible
of civil wars. In Baden, the acceptance
of the Frankfort constitution,
and <i>not its rejection</i>, by a well-meaning,
mild, but perhaps weak
ruler, was eagerly seized upon as
a pretext for disaffection, armed
insurrection, civil war; while Wurtemberg,
where it was received by
the king, although with evident unwillingness,
or, as he himself expressed
it, in a somewhat overstrained
tone of pathos, "with bleeding and
broken heart," narrowly escaped
being involved in the same fearful
issue. The process by which this
result was attained in Baden was
curious enough, although fully in
accordance with the usual man&oelig;uvres
of the anarchical leaders of the day,
who, while denouncing Jesuitism, in
many parts of the world, as the great
evil and anti-popular influence against
which they have most to contend,
evidently adopt the supposed and
most denounced principle of Jesuitism&mdash;that
"the ends justify the
means"&mdash;as their own peculiar line
of conduct; and use every species of
treachery, deceit, falsehood, and delusion,
as holy and righteous weapons
in the sacred cause of liberty, or of
that idol of their worship which they
choose to nickname liberty. In showing
what revolutionising Germany
has, or rather perhaps has not, as yet,
attained, we must briefly, then, revert
once more to that insurrection and
its suppression, that has so fearfully
devastated the duchy of Baden, and
its neighbouring province of the Palatinate,
which, although belonging to
Bavaria, is so distant and divided
from that kingdom as to be included,
without further distinction, in the
same designation.</p>

<p>It was with almost prophetic spirit
that we, last year, spoke of the unhappy
duchy of Baden, which had
then, as since, the least cause of complaint
of any of the several subdivisions
of Germany. "Nothing," it
was then said, "can be more uneasy
and disquieting than its appearance.
In this part of Germany, the revolutionary
fermentation appears far more
active, and is more visible in the
manner, attitude, and language of the
lower classes, than even in those (at
that time) hotbeds of revolutionary
movement, Austria and Prussia. To
this state of things the confinity with
agitated France, and consequently a
more active affinity with its ideas,
caught like a fever from a next-door
neighbour's house, the agency of the
emissaries from the ultra-republican
Parisian clubs, who find an easier
access across the frontiers, and the fact
also that the unhappy duchy has been,
if not the native country, at least
the scene of action of the republican
insurgents, Hecker and Struve,
have all combined to contribute."
"It is impossible to enter the duchy,
and converse with the peasant population,
formerly and proverbially so
peacefully disposed in patriarchal
Germany&mdash;formerly so smiling, so
ready, so civil, perhaps only too
obsequious in their signs of respect,
now so insolent and rude&mdash;without
finding the poison of those various
influences gathering and festering in
all their ideas, words, and actions."</p>

<p>Such were the views written last
year; and this state of things has
since continued to increase, as regards
popular fermentation, and disposition
to insurrection. Demagogic agitators
swarmed in the land, instilling poison
wherever they went, and rejoicing as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
they saw the <i>virus</i> do its work in the
breaking out of festering sores. The
tactics of this party, in all lands, has
been to try their experiments upon
the military; but it has only been in
Baden, thus demoralised, and disorganised
by weakness of sufferance,
and a vain spirit of concession and
looked-for conciliation, that these
subjects were found fitting for the
efforts of the experimentalisers. The
<i>virus</i> had already done its work
among them, to the utmost hopes of
the poisoning crew, when the New
Frankfort Constitution&mdash;the rejection
of which was to be the signal for a
<i>quasi</i> legal insurrection&mdash;was accepted
by the Grand-duke of Baden. But
the agitators were not to be thus
baffled. A pretence, however shallow
and false, was easily found in the
well-prepared fermentation of men's
minds; and the military, summoned
by demagogic leaders to tumultuous
meetings, were easily persuaded that
a false, or at least a defective draught
of the new boasted constitution had
been read to them and proclaimed&mdash;that,
in the <i>real</i> constitution, an enactment
provided that the soldiers were
to choose and elect their own officers&mdash;that
this paragraph had been carefully
suppressed; and that the military
had been thus deprived and
cheated of their rights. Easily detected
as might have been the falsehood,
it nevertheless succeeded in
its purposes. The military insurrection,
in which the tumultuous and
evil-disposed of the lower classes, and
a great portion of the disaffected
peasantry joined, broke out on the
very evening of one of these great
meetings; and, by means of a well-prepared
and actively organised concentration
of measures, in various
parts of the duchy at the same time.
Thus was the very acceptance of the
revolutionary constitution made in
Baden a pretext to stir the land to
insurrection.</p>

<p>After the full account already published
in these pages, it is needless
to enter into detail, with regard to
the events which marked the progress
and suppression of this great
insurrection. It is only to show the
insensate state of mind to which revolutionary
agents, left to do their
will, were able to work up the military;
the confused ideas and purposes,
with which these would-be revolutionising
German heads were filled; the
ignorance that was displayed among
these men, said to be <i>enlightened</i> by
"patriots," and their want of all
comprehension of the very rights for
which they pretended to clamour&mdash;in
fact, the utter absence of any experience
gained by the lower classes,
and especially the military portion of
them, after more than a year's revolutionising,
that we briefly recapitulate
some of the leading events of the outbreak.
It was with a perfect headlong
frenzy that the garrison of the fortress
of Rastadt first revolted; it was with
just as much appearance of madness
that the mutiny broke out simultaneously
in the other garrison towns.
There was every evidence of rabid
mania in the deplorable scenes which
followed, when superior officers in vain
attempted with zeal and courage to
stem the torrent, and, in many instances,
lost their lives at the hands
of the infuriated soldiery; when others
were cruelly and disgracefully mis-handled,
and two or three, unable to
contend with the sense of dishonour
and degradation which overwhelmed
them as military men, rushed, maddened
also, into suicide, to have their
very corpses mutilated by the men
whom they had treated, as it happened,
with kindness and concession; when
others again, who had escaped over
the frontiers, were, by a violation of
the Wurtemberg territory, captured,
led back prisoners, and immured, under
every circumstances of cruelty and
ignominy, in the fortress they had in
vain attempted loyally to guard.
There was madness in all this; and
then we learn, to complete the
deplorable picture, from a very accurate
account of all the circumstances,
lately published by a Baden
officer, as well as from another pamphlet,
more circumscribed in detail, but
fully as conclusive as regards narration
of feeling, in almost every page,
that when the insurgent soldiers were
asked by their officers what they
wanted, they could only answer, "Our
rights and those of the people;" and,
when questioned further, "What are
those rights?" either held their tongues
and shook their heads in ignorance,
or replied with the strangest <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
"That you ought to know better than
we." Still more strikingly characteristic
of the insensate nature of the
struggle are the examples where
the infatuated soldiers parted from
their officers with tears in their eyes,
then, driven on by their agitators,
hunted them to the death; and then,
again, with eyes opened at last to
their delusion, sobbed forth the bitterest
repentance for their blindness.</p>

<p>It has been already seen how the
Grand-duke fled the land, how Baden
was given up, in a state of utter
anarchy, to a Provisional government,
that existed but long enough
to be utterly rent and torn by the
very instruments which its members
had contributed to set in movement;
and to a disorganised, tumultuous
army, prepared to domineer and
tyrannise in its newly-acquired self-power;
how the insurrection was
suppressed, after an unwilling appeal
to Prussia by the Grand-duke&mdash;how
the insurgent troops were dispersed by
means of a Prussian army&mdash;and how
Rastadt was finally surrendered by
the revolutionary leaders. As these
events have already been detailed, and
as it is our purpose to ask in general,
"What has revolutionising Germany
attained?" we need do no more
on this head, than ask, "What,
by its late movement, has revolutionising
Baden attained?" "What then
is the present position, and the present
aspect of the country, after the
armed suppression?"</p>

<p>What, indeed! Poor old Father
Rhine, although still, in these revolutionary
days, somewhat depressed in
spirits, does not now, however, exhibit
that aspect of utter melancholy and
despair which we last year pictured;
he has even contrived to reassume
something of that conceited air which
we have so often witnessed in his
old face. Foreign tourists, if not in
the pleasure-seeking shoals of aforetime,
at least in very decent sprinklings,
return again to pay him visits;
and the hotels upon his banks give
evidence that his courts are not wholly
deserted. Ems, from various causes
independent of its natural beauties&mdash;the
principal one of which has been
the pilgrimage of French Legitimists
to the heir of the fallen Bourbons,
during his short residence in that
sweet bathing-place&mdash;has overflowed
with "guests." Homburg has had
scarcely a bed to offer to the wanderer
on his arrival. Rhenish Prussia,
then, has profited, by its comparative
state of quiet, somewhat to
redeem its losses of last year. But
the poor duchy of Baden still hangs
its head mournfully; and Baden-Baden,
the fairest queen of German
watering-places, finds itself utterly
deprived of its well-deserved crown
of supremacy, and seems to have
covered itself, in shame, with a veil
of sadness. Although all now wears
again a smiling face of peaceful quiet,
and Prussian uniforms, which at least
have the merit of studding with colour
the gay scene, give warrant for peace
by the force of the bayonet, yet
tourists seem to avoid the scene of
the late fearful convulsions, as they
would a house in which the plague
has raged, although now declared
wholly disinfected. A few wandering
"guests" only come and go, and tell
the world of foreign wanderers with
dismal faces, "Baden-Baden is
empty!" Travellers seem to hurry
through the country, as swiftly as the
railroad can whirl them across it, towards
Strasburg and B&acirc;le&mdash;ay! rather
to republican France, or fermenting
Switzerland: they appear unwilling
to turn aside and seek rest among the
beautiful hills of a country where the
reek of blood, or the vapour of the
cannon-smoke, may be still upon the
air. In Baden-Baden bankrupt hotels
are closed; and the lower classes,
who have been accustomed to amass
comparative wealth by the annual influx
of foreigners, either by their produce,
or in the various different occupations
of attending upon visitors,
wear the most evident expression of
disappointment, listlessness, and want.
Baden pays the bitter penalty of insurrection,
by being utterly crippled
in one of the branches of its most
material interests. It bears as quiet
an aspect outwardly, however, as if
it were sitting, in humiliation and
shame, upon the stool of repentance.
There is nothing (if they go not beyond
the surface) to prevent foreign
pleasure or health seekers from finding
their pleasure or repose in this
sweet country; and in what has been
simply, but correctly, termed "one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the loveliest spots upon God's earth,"
as of yore; but they are evidently shy,
and look askance upon it. Baden
pays its penalty.</p>

<p>Although nature smiles, however,
upon mountain and valley, and romantic
village, as cheerily as before,
and there is gaiety still in every sunbeam,
yet traces of the horrors lately
enacted in the land are still left, which
cannot fail to strike the eye of the
most listless, mere outward observer,
as he whisks along, the country&mdash;sometimes
in the trampled plain, on
which nature has not been as yet
able to throw her all-covering veil
again, and which shows where has
been the battle-field, which should
have been the harvest-field, and was
not&mdash;sometimes in the shattered wall
or ruined house&mdash;sometimes in the
wood cut down or burned. At every
step the traveller may be shown, by
his guide, the spots on which battles
or skirmishes have taken place, where
the cannon has lately roared, where
blood has been shed, where men have
fallen in civil contest. Here he may
be conveyed over the noble railway-bridge
of the Neckar, and see the
broken parapet, and hear how the
insurgents had commenced their work
of destruction upon the edifice, but
were arrested in its accomplishment
by the rapid advance of the Prussian
troops. Here again he may mark the
late repairs of the railroad, where it
has been cut up into trenches, to prevent
the speedy conveyance of the
war-material of the enemy. If he
lingers on his way, he may seek in
vain in the capital, or other "residence
towns" of Baden, where ducal
palaces stand, for the treasures of
antiquity which were their boast.
Pillage has done its work: insurgents
have appropriated these objects of
value to themselves, in the name of
the people; and the costly and bejewelled
trappings of the East, the
rich gold inlaid armour, and the valuable
arms, brought in triumph home
by the Margrave Louis of Baden, after
his Turkish campaigns, are now dispersed,
none knows where, after having
fed the greed of some French
red-republican or Polish democrat.
But it is more particularly in the
neighbourhood of the fortress town of
Rastadt, where the insurgents last
held out, that the strongest traces
of the late convulsions may be
found. Marks of devastation are
everywhere perceptible in the country
around; the remains of the temporary
defences of the besiegers still lie scattered
in newly dug trenches; and the
blackened walls of a railway station-house,
by the road-side, tell him how
it was bombarded from the town by
the besieged insurgents, and then
burned to the ground, lest it should
afford shelter to the besiegers. These
are, however, after all, but slight
evidences of what the duchy of
Baden has attained by its late revolution.
If we go below the surface, the
dark spots are darker and far more
frequent still.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enter into conversation
with persons of any class,
without discovering, either directly or
indirectly, how deeply rooted still
remains the demoralisation of the
country. The bitterness of feeling,
and the revolutionary mania of revolutionising,
to obtain no one can tell
what, may have been crushed down
and overawed; but they evidently
still smoulder below the surface and
ferment. The volcano-mouth has
been filled with a mass of Prussian
bayonets; but it still burns below: it
is clogged, not extinct. The democratic
spirit has been too deeply infused
to be drugged out of the mass
of the people by the dose of military
force. Fearful experience seems to
have taught the sufferers little or
nothing; and although, here and
there, may be found evidences of
bitter repentance, consequent upon
personal loss of property, or family
suffering, yet even below that may
be constantly found a profound bitterness,
and an eager rancour, against
unknown and visionary enemies.
Talk to that poor old woman, who
sits with pale face upon a stile on the
mountain-side. She will weep for
the son she has lost among the insurgents,
and deplore, with bitter
tears, his error and his delusion; and
yet, if you gain her confidence, she
will raise her head, and, with some
fire in her sunken eye, tell you that
she has still a son at home, a boy,
her last-born, who bides but his time
to take up the musket against "those,
accursed enemies of the people and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
the people's rights!" Enter into
conversation with that shopkeeper
behind his counter, or that hotel-keeper
in his palace hotel&mdash;both are
"well to do" in the world, or have
been so, until revolutions shattered
the commerce of the one, or deprived
the other of wealthy visitors&mdash;you
may expect to find in them a feeling,
taught them at least by experience,
against any further convulsion. No
such thing; they are as ripe for further
revolution as the lower classes, and
as eager to avenge their losses&mdash;not
upon those who have occasioned
them, but upon those who would
have averted them. Even in the
upper classes you will find that craving
for the idol, "United Germany,"
to which we have before alluded, and
which seems to invite revolutions,
rather than to fear them. Of course
exceptions may be found, and many,
to the examples here given; but in
putting these figures into the foreground
of the picture to be painted
of the state of Baden, (if not of
Germany in general,) we firmly
believe we have given characteristic
types of the prevailing feelings of the
country. German heads, once let
loose into the regions of ideal fantasy,
be it political or philosophical, or the
strange and unpractical mixture of
both, seem as if they were not to be
recalled to the earth and the realms
of palpable truth by the lessons of
experience, however strongly, and
even terribly, inculcated.</p>

<p>The prevailing feeling, however, at
the present time in Baden, among the
lower classes, seems the hatred of
the occupation of the Prussian army,
which has saved the land from utter
anarchy. The very men who have
been taught by their demagogues to
clamour for "German Unity" as a
pretext for insurrection, look on the
Prussian military as usurping aliens
and foreign oppressors. Military occupation
is certainly the prevailing
feature of the country. Prussian
troops are everywhere&mdash;in every town,
in every village, in every house, in
every hovel. Whichever way you turn
your eyes, there are soldiers&mdash;soldiers&mdash;soldiers&mdash;horse
and foot. The military
seem to form by far the greater
half of the population; and, much
disposed as many may have been to
greet the return of the Grand-duke
to his states, as the symbol of the
cause of order, yet, in spite of birthday
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, and banners, and garlands,
and loyal devices in flowers, which
have bedecked the road of the traveller
in the land not long since, these same
men will grumble to you of those
"accursed Prussian soldiers," who
alone were able to restore him to his
country, when the Baden army, as
troops to support their sovereign,
existed no longer&mdash;when those who
composed it fought at the head of the
insurgents. The very shadow of a
Baden army, even, is not now to be
found. And it is this fact, and the
evidences that an insurrectionary
spirit is still widely spread abroad,
which are given as the excuse of a
continued Prussian occupation. It is
difficult, certainly, for a traveller in
a land so lately convulsed, and still
placed in circumstances so peculiar,
to arrive at truth. Prussian officers
will tell him how, on the arrival of
the Prussian army in the country,
and the dispersion of the insurgents,
flowers were strewn along its path
by the populations, who thus seemingly
hailed the Prussian soldiers as
their deliverers; and in the next
breath they will inform him that this
was only done from <i>fear</i>, and that,
were it not for this salutary <i>fear</i>, the
insurrection would break forth again.
He may suspect that this account is
given as the pretext for a continued
occupation of the land. But Baden
officials will tell him that such is the
case&mdash;that Prussian troops alone keep,
down a further rising; and if he still
suspects his source, he will certainly
find among the people, at all events,
both the hatred and the fear. Meanwhile
the Prussian officers seem to
think that both these feelings are
necessary for the pacification of the
land; and, upon their own showing,
or rather boasting, they inculcate
them by flogging insolent peasants
across the cannon, by shooting down
insurgent prisoners, who spit upon
them from prison windows, without
any other form of trial, and by other
autocratic repressive measures of a
similar stamp. Meanwhile, also, they
seem, by all their words as well as
actions, to look upon Baden as a
conquered province, acquired to Prussia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
and openly and loudly vaunt
their <i>conquest</i>. Let it not be supposed
that this is exaggeration. It
is the general tone of Prussian officers&mdash;ay,
and even of the common Prussian
soldiers occupying the duchy of
Baden&mdash;with a super-addition of true
Prussian conceit in manner, indescribable
by words. In spite of what we
may read in late newspaper reports,
then, of conciliation between the two
great powers of Northern and Southern
Germany, we may well ask, What
will rival Austria say to this? Where
is the prospect here of a great United
Germany? And, after this <i>resum&eacute;</i> of
the present position of Baden as a
part, we may well ask, also, What
has revolutionising Germany attained
as a whole?</p>

<p>We have seen that the main object,
and at all events the chief pretext
of the revolution, the establishment
of a great United Germany,
is still further from the grasp of the
revolutionising country than ever&mdash;although
it remains still the clamour
and the cry. Prussia may point in
irony to its advances, by the occupation
of the duchy of Baden and of
Hamburg, and by its acquisition of the
principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,
and smile while it says that it
has effected thus much towards a union
of Germany under one head. Or, in
more serious mood, it may put forward
its projected alliance of the three
northern German potentates. But,
with regard to the former, what, in
spite of the reports we hear of conciliation,
will be the conduct of jealous
Austria, now at last unshackled in its
dealings? The latter only shows still
more the cleft that divides the northern
portion of the would-be united
country from the southern. "United
Germany" only remains, then, a plaything
in the hands of dreamers and
democrats&mdash;a pretty toy, about which
they may build up airy castles to the
one&mdash;an instrument blunted and
notched, for the present, to the other.
What has revolutionising Germany
attained here?</p>

<p>What declared last year the manifesto
of Prince Leiningen, then Minister
for Foreign Affairs, and leading member
of the cabinet of the newly established
central power&mdash;put forward, as
it was, as the <i>programme</i> of the new
government for all Germany? It
denounced "jealousies between the
individual states, and revilings of the
northern by the southern parts of the
empire," as "criminal absurdities;"
and yet went on to say that "if the
old spirit of discord and separation
were still too powerfully at work&mdash;if
the jealousy between race and race,
between north and south, were still too
strongly felt&mdash;the nation must convince
itself of the fact, and return to the old
feudal system." It declared, however,
in the same breath as it were, that "to
retrograde to a confederation of states
would only be to create a mournful
period of transition to fresh catastrophes,
and new revolutions." Failing
of the realisation of the great union,
to which the revolution was supposed
to tend, the manifesto then placed revolutionising
Germany between the
alternative of returning to a part,
which it declared impossible, or further
convulsions and civil wars. It put
Germany, in fact, into a cleft stick.
Has a year's revolution tended to extricate
it from this position? The
alternative, remains the same&mdash;Germany
sticks in the cleft stick as much
as ever. Revolutionising Germany,
with all its throes and all its efforts,
has attained nothing to relieve it from
this position. Without accepting the
manifesto of Prince Leiningen, either
as necessarily prophetic, or as a political
dictum, from which there is no
evasion or escape, it is yet impossible
to look back upon it, while trying to
discover what revolutionising Germany
has attained, without sad presentiments,
without looking with much
mournful apprehension upon the future
fate of the country. To return, however
to the present state of Germany&mdash;for
the investigation of that is our
purpose, and not speculation upon the
future, although none may look upon
the present without asking with a
sigh, "What is to become of Germany?"</p>

<p>We find the revolutionary spirit
crushed by the events of the last year,
but not subdued; writhing, but not
avowing itself vanquished. The fermentation
is as great as heretofore:
experience seems to have taught the
German children in politics no useful
lesson. Now that the great object, for
which the revolution appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
struggle, has received so notable a
check, the confusion of purposes, (if
German political rhapsodies may be
called such;) of projects, (if, indeed, in
such visionary schemes there be any,)
and pretexts, (of a nature so evidently
false,) is greater than ever&mdash;the confusion
not only exists, but ferments,
and generates foul air, which must find
vent somewhere, be it even in imagination.
Of the revolutionary spirits
whom we sketched last year in
Germany, the students alone seem
somewhat to have learned a lesson of
experience and tactics. Although many
may have been found in the ranks of
insurgents, yet the general mass has
sadly sobered down, and, it may be
hoped, acquired more reason and
method. The Jews&mdash;we cannot again
now inquire into the strange whys
and wherefores&mdash;still remain the restless,
gnawing, cankering, agitating
agents of revolutionary movement.
The insolence and coarseness of the
lower classes increases into bitter rancour,
and has been in no way amended
by concession and a show of good-will.
Among the middle-lower classes, the
most restless and reckless spirits, it
appears from well-drawn statistical
accounts, are the village schoolmasters,
(as in France)&mdash;to exemplify that
"a little learning is a dangerous
thing"&mdash;the barbers, and the tailors.
Had we time, it might form the subject
of curious speculation to attempt
to discover why these two latter
occupations, (and especially the last
one) induce, more than all others,
heated brains and revolutionary
habits; but we cannot stop on our
way to play with such curious questions.
Over all the relations of social,
as well as public life, hover politics
like a deleterious atmosphere, blighting
all that is bright and fair, withering art
in all its branches, science, and social
intercourse. And, good heavens, what
politics!&mdash;the politics of a bedlamite
philosopher in his ravings. In the
late festivities, given in honour of
Goethe at Frankfort, the city of
his birth, to commemorate the hundredth
anniversary of that event,
when it might have been supposed
that all men might have, for once,
united to do homage to the memory
of one whom Germans considered
their greatest spirit, politics again
interfered to thwart, and oppose, and
spoil. The democratic party endeavoured
to prevent the supplies offered
to be given by the town for the festivities,
because they saw the names of
those they called the "aristocrats,"
among the list of the committee, even
although men of all classes were invited
to join it; and, when a serenade
was given before the house in which
the poet was born, the musicians were
driven away, and their torches extinguished,
by a band of so-called "patriots,"
who insisted upon singing, in
the place of the appointed <i>cantato</i>
composed for the occasion, the revolutionary
chorus in honour of the republican
Hecker&mdash;the now famous
song of the revolutionary battle-field,
the <i>Hecker-Lied</i>. And such an example
of this fermentation of politics
in all the circumstances of life, however
far from political intents, is not singular:
it is only characteristic of
the everyday doings of the times.
Among the upper classes, those feelings
which we last year summed up in
the characteristic words, "the dulness
of doubt and the stupor of apprehension,"
have only increased in intensity.
None see an issue out of the troubled
passage of the revolution. Their eyes
are blinded by a mist, and they
stumble on their way, dreading a precipice
at every step. This impression
depicts more especially the feelings of
the so-called moderates and liberal
conservatives who had their representatives
among the best elements of
the Frankfort parliament, and who,
with the vision of a united Germany
before their eyes, laboured to reach
that visionary goal, at the same time
that they endeavoured to stem the
ever-invading torrent of ultra-revolution
and red-republicanism. "The
dulness of doubt, and the stupor of
apprehension," seem indeed to have
fallen upon them since the last vain
meeting of the heads of their party in
Gotha. They let their hands fall
upon their laps, and sit shaking their
heads. Gagern, the boldest spirit,
and one of the best hearts that
represents their cause and has struggled
for its maintenance, is represented
as wholly prostrate in spirit, unstrung&mdash;<i>missgestimmt</i>,
as the Germans
have it. He has retired entirely into
private life, to await events with aching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
heart. If any feeling is still expressed
by the moderate liberals, it has been,
of late, sympathy in the fate of Hungary,
which the Prussians put forward
visibly only out of opposition to Austria,
at the same time that, with but
little consistency, they condemn all
the agents of the Hungarian struggle.</p>

<p>We have endeavoured to give a
faint and fleeting sketch of what revolutionising
Germany has attained, after
a year's revolution. The picture is a
dark one, of a truth, but we believe
in no ways overdone. In actual progress
the sum-total appears to be a
zero. The position of Germany, although
calmer on the surface, is as
difficult, as embarrassing, as much in
the "cleft stick," as when we speculated
upon it last year. All the well-wishers
of the country and of mankind
may give it their hopes; but when
they look for realisation of their hopes,
they can only shake their heads, with
the Germans themselves, as they ask,

<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p>The next evening our friend the
Captain found his fair audience by
the taffrail increased to a round dozen,
while several of the gentlemen passengers
lounged near, and the chief officer
divided his attention between the gay
group of ladies below and the "fanning"
main-topsail high up, with its
corresponding studding-sail hung far
out aloft to the breeze; the narrative
having by this time contracted a sort
of professional interest, even to his
matter-of-fact taste, which enabled
him to enjoy greatly the occasional
glances of sly humour directed to him
by his superior, for whom he evidently
entertained a kind of admiring respect,
that seemed to be enhanced as he listened.
As for the commander himself,
he related the adventures in
question with a spirit and vividness of
manner that contributed to them no
small charm; amusingly contrasted
with the cool, dry, indifferent sort of
gravity of countenance, amidst which
the keen gray seawardly eye, under
the peak of the naval cap, kept changing
and twinkling as it seemed to run
through the experience of youth again&mdash;sometimes
almost approaching to
an undeniable wink. The expression
of it at this time, however, was more
serious, while it appeared to run along
the dotted reef-band of the mizen-topsail
above, as across the entry in
a log-book, and as if there were something
interesting to come.</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>, my dear captain," asked his
matronly relative, "what comes next?
You and your friend had picked up a&mdash;a-what
was it <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I remember, ma'am," said the
naval man, laughing; "the bottle&mdash;that
was where I was. Well, as you
may conceive, this said scrap of penmanship
in the bottle <i>did</i> take both of
us rather on end; and for two or three
minutes Westwood and I sat staring
at each other and the uncouth-looking
fist, in an inquiring sort of way, like
two cocks over a beetle. Westwood,
for his part, was doubtful of its being
the Planter at all; but the whole
thing, when I thought of it, made
itself as clear to me, so far, as two
half-hitches, and the angrier I was at
myself for being <i>done</i> by a frog-eating,
bloody-politeful set of Frenchmen like
these. Could we only have clapped
eyes on the villanous thieving craft
at the time, by Jove! if I wouldn't
have manned a boat from the Indiaman,
leave or no leave, and boarded
her in another fashion! But where
they were now, what they meant, and
whether we should ever see them
again, heaven only knew. For all we
could say, indeed, something strange
might have turned up at home in
Europe&mdash;a new war, old Boney got
loose once more, or what not&mdash;and I
could scarce fall asleep for guessing
and bothering over the matter, as
restless as the first night we cruised
down Channel in the old Pandora."</p>

<p>Early in the morning-watch a sudden
stir of the men on deck woke me, and I
bundled up in five minutes' time. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
it was only the second mate setting
them to wash decks, and out they came
from all quarters, yawning, stretching
themselves, and tucking up their
trousers, as they passed the full
buckets lazily along; while a couple
of boys could be seen hard at work to
keep the head-pump going, up against
the gray sky over the bow. However,
I was so anxious to have the
first look-out ahead, that I made a
bold push through the thick of it for
the bowsprit, where I went out till I
could see nothing astern of me but the
Indiaman's big black bows and figurehead,
swinging as it were round the
spar I sat upon, with the spread of
her canvass coming dim after me out
of the fog, and a lazy snatch of foam
lifting to her cut-water, as the breeze
died away. The sun was just beginning
to rise; ten minutes before, it
had been almost quite dark; there was
a mist on the water, and the sails
were heavy with dew; when a circle
began to open round us, where the
surface looked as smooth and dirty as
in a dock, the haze seeming to shine
through, as the sunlight came sifting
through it, like silver gauze. You saw
the big red top of the sun glare against
the water-line, and a wet gleam of
crimson came sliding from one smooth
blue swell to another; while the back
of the haze astern turned from blue
to purple, and went lifting away into
vapoury streaks and patches. All of
a sudden the ship came clear out aloft
and on the water, with her white
streak as bright as snow, her fore-royal
and truck gilded, her broad foresail
as red as blood, and every face on
deck shining as they looked ahead,
where I felt like a fellow held up on a
toasting-fork, against the fiery wheel
the sun made ere clearing the horizon.
Two or three strips of cloud melted in
it like lumps of sugar in hot wine;
and, after overhauling the whole seaboard
round and round, I kept straining
my eyes into the light, with the
notion there was something to be seen
in that quarter, but to no purpose;
there wasn't the slightest sign of the
brig or any other blessed thing. What
struck me a little, however, was the
look of the water just as the fog was
clearing away: the swell was sinking
down, the wind fallen for the time to
a dead calm; and when the smooth
face of it caught the light full from
aloft, it seemed to come out all over
long-winding wrinkles and eddies,
running in a broad path, as it were,
twisted and woven together, right into
the wake of the sunrise. When I came
inboard from the bowsprit, big Harry
and another grumpy old salt were
standing by the bitts, taking a forecastle
observation, and gave me a
squint, as much as to ask if I had come
out of the east, or had been trying to
pocket the flying-jib-boom. "D'you
notice anything strange about the
<i>water</i> at all?" I asked in an offhand
sort of way, wishing to see if the
men had remarked aught of what I
suspected. The old fellow gave me
a queer look out of the tail of his eye,
and the ugly man seemed to be measuring
me from head to foot. "No,
sir," said the first, carelessly; "can't
say as how I does,"&mdash;while Harry
coolly commenced sharpening his
sheath-knife on his shoe. "Did you
ever hear of currents hereabouts?"
said I to the other man. "Hereaway!"
said he; "why, bless ye, sir,
it's unpossible as I <i>could</i> ha' heer'd tell
on sich a thing, 'cause, ye see, sir, there
an't none so far out at sea, sir&mdash;al'ays
axin' <i>your</i> parding, ye know, sir!"
while he hitched up his trousers and
looked aloft, as if there were somewhat
wrong about the jib-halliards.</p>

<p>The Indiaman by this time had
quite lost steerage-way, and came
sheering slowly round, broadside to
the sun, while the water began to
glitter like a single sheet of quicksilver,
trembling and swelling to the firm
edge of it far off; the pale blue sky
filling deep aloft with light, and a long
white haze growing out of the horizon
to eastward. I kept still looking over
from the fore-chains with my arms
folded, and an eye to the water on the
starboard side, next the sun, where, just
a fathom or two from the bright copper
of her sheathing along the water-line,
you could see into it. Every now
and then little bells and bubbles, as I
thought, would come up in it and
break short of the surface; and sometimes
I fancied the line of a slight
ripple, as fine as a rope-yarn, went
turning and glistening, round one of
the ship's quarters, across her shadow.
Just then the old sailor behind me
shoved his face over the bulwark, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
all warts and wrinkles, like a ripe
walnut-shell, with a round knob of a
nose in the middle of it, and seemed
to be watching to see it below,
when he suddenly squirted his tobacco-juice
as far out as possible
alongside, and gave his mouth a wipe
with the back of his tarry yellow
hand; catching my eye in a shame-faced
sort of way, as I glanced first at
him and then at his floating property.
I leant listlessly over the rail, watching
the patch of oily yellow froth, as
it floated quietly on the smooth face
of the water; till all at once I started
to observe that beyond all question it
had crept slowly away past our starboard
bow, clear of the ship, and at
last melted into the glittering blue
brine. The two men noticed my attention,
and stared along with me;
while the owner of the precious cargo
himself kept looking after it wistfully
into the wake of the sunlight, as if he
were a little hurt; then aloft and
round about, in a puzzled sort of
way, to see if the ship hadn't perhaps
taken a sudden sheer to port. "Why,
my man," I said, meeting his oyster-like
old sea-eye, "what's the reason
of <i>that</i>?&mdash;perhaps there is some current
or other here, after all, eh?"
Just as he meant to answer, however,
I noticed his watch-mate give him a
hard shove in the ribs with his huge
elbow, and a quick screw of his
weather top-light, while he kept the
lee one doggedly fixed on myself. I
accordingly walked slowly aft as if to
the quarterdeck, and came round the
long-boat again, right abreast of them.</p>

<p>Harry was pacing fore and aft with
his arms folded, when his companion
made some remark on the heat, peering
all about him, and then right up
into the air aloft. "Well then,
shipmate," said Harry, dabbing his
handkerchief back into his tarpaulin
again, "I've seen worse, myself,&mdash;ownly,
'twas in the Bight o' Benin,
look ye,&mdash;an' afore the end on it,
d'ye see, we hove o'board nine of
a crew, let alone six dozen odds of a
cargo!" "Cargo!" exclaimed his
companion in surprise. "Ay, black
<i>passengers</i> they was, ye know, old
ship!" answered the ugly rascal,
coolly; "an' I tell ye what it is, Jack,
I never sails yet with passengers
aboard, but some'at bad turned up in
the end,&mdash;al'ays one or another on
'em's got a foul turn in his conscience,
ye see! I say, 'mate," continued he,
looking round, "didn't ye note that
'ere 'long-shore looking customer as
walked aft just now, with them bloody
soft quest'ns o' his about&mdash;" "Why,"
said Jack, "it's him Jacobs and the
larboard watch calls the Green Hand,
an' a blessed good joke they has about
him, to all appearance,&mdash;but they keeps
it pretty close." "Close, be d&mdash;&mdash;d!"
growled Harry, "I doesn't like the
cut of his jib, I tell ye, shipmate!
Jist you take my word for it, that
'ere fellow's done some'at bad at
home, or he's bent on some'at bad
afloat&mdash;it's all one! Don't ye mark
how he keeps boxhaulin' and skulking
fore an' aft, not to say looking
out to wind'ard every now an'
again, as much as he expected a
sail to heave in sight!" "Well,
I'm blowed but you're right, Harry!"
said the other, taking off his hat to
scratch his head, thoughtfully. "Ay,
and what's more," went on Harry,
"it's just comed ath'art me as how
I've clapped eyes on the chap somewheres
or other afore this&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n me
if I don't think it was amongst a gang
o' Spanish pirates I saw tried for
their lives and let off, in the Havanney!"
"Thank you, my man!"
thought I, as I leant against the
booms on the other side, "the devil
you did!&mdash;a wonder it wasn't in the
Old Bailey, which would have been
more possible, though less romantic,&mdash;seeing
in the Havannah I never was!"
The curious thing was that I began
to have a faint recollection, myself, of
having seen this same cross-grained
beauty, or heard his voice, before;
though where and how it was, I
couldn't for the life of me say at the
moment. "Lord bless us, Harry!"
faltered out the old sailor, "ye don't
mean it!&mdash;sich a young, soft-looked
shaver, too!" "Them smooth-skinned
sort o' coves is kimmonly the worst,
'mate," replied Harry; "for that
matter ye may be d&mdash;&mdash;d sure he's got
his chums aboard,&mdash;an' how does <i>we</i>
know but the ship's <i>sold</i>, from stem
to starn? There's that 'ere black-avizzed
parson, now, and one or two
more aft&mdash;cuss me if that 'ere feller
smells brine for the first time! An' as
for this here Bob Jacobs o' yours, blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
me if there an't over many of his kind
in the whole larboard watch, Jack!
A man-o'-war's-man's al'ays a blackguard
out on a man-o'-war, look ye!"
"Why, bless me, shipmate," said
Jack, lowering his voice, "by that
recknin', a man don't know his friends
in this here craft! The sooner we
gives the mate a hint, the better, to
my thinking?" "No, blow me, no,
Jack," said Harry, "keep all fast, or
ye'll kick up a worse nitty, old boy!
Jist you hould on till ye see what's to
turn up,&mdash;ownly stand by and look
out for squalls, that's all! There's
the skipper laid up below in his berth,
I hears,&mdash;and to my notions, that 'ere
mate of ours is no more but a blessed
soldier, with his navigation an' his
head-work, an' be blowed to him&mdash;where's
he runned the ship, I'd like
to know, messmate!" "Well, strike
me lucky if I'm fit to guess!" answered
Jack, gloomily. "No, s'help me
Bob, if he knows hisself!" said Harry.
"But here's, what <i>I</i> says, anyhow,&mdash;if
so be we heaves in sight of a pirate,
or bumps ashore on a ileyand i' the
dark, shiver my tawsels if I doesn't
have a clip with a handspike at that
'ere soft-sawderin' young blade in the
straw hat!" "Well, my fine fellow,"
thought I, "many thanks to you
again, but I certainly shall look out
for <i>you</i>!" All this time I couldn't
exactly conceive whether the sulky
rascal really suspected anything of
the kind, or whether he wasn't in fact
sounding his companion, and perhaps
others of the crew, as to how far they
would go in case of an opportunity
for mischief; especially when I heard
him begin to speculate if "that 'ere
proud ould beggar of a naboob, aft
yonder, musn't have a sight o' gould
and jowels aboard with him!" "Why,
for the matter o' that, 'mate," continued
he, "I doesn't signify the
twinklin' of a marlinspike, mind ye,
what lubberly trick they sarves this
here craft,&mdash;so be ownly ye can get
anyhow ashore, when all's done! It's
nouther ship-law nor shore-law, look
ye, 'mate, as houlds good on a bloody
dazart!" "Ay, ay, true enough,
bo'," said the other, "but what o'
that?&mdash;there an't much signs of a
dazart, I reckon, in this here blue
water!" "Ho!" replied Harry,
rather scornfully, "that's 'cause you
blue-water, long-v'yage chaps isn't up
to them, brother! There's you and
that 'ere joker in the striped slops,
Jack, chaffing away over the side
jist now about a current,&mdash;confounded
sharp he thinks hisself, too!&mdash;but
d'ye think Harry Foster an't got his
weather-eye open? For my part I
thinks more of the streak o' haze
yonder-away, right across the starboard
bow, nor all the currents in&mdash;"
"Ay, ay," said Jack, stretching out
again to look, "the heat, you means?"
"Heat!" exclaimed the ugly topman,
"heat be blowed! Hark ye, 'mate,
it <i>may</i> be a strip o' cloud, no doubt,
or the steam over a sand-bank,&mdash;but
so be the calm lasts so long, and you
sees that 'ere streak again by sundown,
with a touch o' yallow in't&mdash;"
"What&mdash;<i>what</i>, shipmate?" asked
Jack, breathless with anxiety. "Then,
dammee, it's the black coast iv Africay,
and <i>no</i> mistake!" said Harry. "And
what's more," continued the fellow,
coolly, after taking a couple of short
turns, "if there <i>be's</i> a current, why,
look ye, it'll set dead in to where the
land lays&mdash;an' I'm blessed if there's
one aboard, breeze or no breeze, as is
man enough for to take her out o'
the suck of a Africane current!" "The
Lord be with us!" exclaimed the
other sailor, in alarm, "what's to be
done, Harry, bo',&mdash;when d'ye mean
for to let them know, aft?" "Why,
maybe I'm wrong, ye know, old
ship," said Harry, "an' a man musn't
go for to larn his betters, ye know,&mdash;by
this time half o' the watch has a
notion on it, at any rate. There's
Dick White, Jack Jones, Jim Sidey,
an' a few more Wapping men, means
to stick together in case o' accidents&mdash;so
d&mdash;n it, Jack, man, ye needn't be in
sich an a taking! What the&mdash;"
(here he came out with a regular string
of topgallant oaths,) "when you finds
a good chance shoved into your fist,
none o' your doin', an't a feller to haul
in the slack of it 'cause he's got a tarry
paw, and ships before the mast? I
tell ye what it is, old ship, 'tan't the
first time you an' me's been cast
away, an' I doesn't care the drawin'
of a rope-yarn, in them here latitudes,
if I'm cast away again! Hark 'ye,
ould boy,&mdash;grog to the masthead, a
grab at the passengers' wallibles,
when they han't no more use for 'em,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
in course&mdash;an' the pick on the ladies,
jist for the takin' o' them ashore!"
"Lord love ye, Harry, belay there!"
said Jack, "what's the good o' talkin'
on what an't like to be?" "Less
like things turns up!" said Harry.
"More by token, if I hasn't pitched
upon my fancy lass a'ready&mdash;an'
who knows, old ship, but you marries
a naboob's darter yet, and gets yourself
shoved all square, like a rig'lar
hare, into his heestate, as they calls
it? For my part, I've more notion of
the <i>maid</i>! An' it'll go hard with
me if we doesn't manage to haul that
'ere mishynar' parson safe ashore on
the strength of it!" "God bless ye,
Harry," answered Jack, somewhat
mournfully, "I'm twice spliced
already!" "Third time's lucky,
though," replied Harry, with a chuckle,
as he walked towards the side again,
and looked over; the rest of the
watch being gathered on the other
bow, talking and laughing; the passengers
beginning to appear on the
poop, and the Scotch second-mate
standing up aft on the taffrail, feeling
for a breath of wind. The big topman
came slowly back to his companion,
and leant himself on the spars
again. "Blowed if I don't think you're
right, 'mate," said he, "you and that
'ere lawyer. You'd a'most say there's
a ripple round her larboard bow just
now, sure enough&mdash;like she were
broadside on to some drift or another.
Hows'ever, that's nouther here nor
there,&mdash;for my part, I sets more count
by the look o' the sky to east'ard,
an' be blowed, shipmate, if that same
yonder don't make me think o' <i>woods</i>!"
"Well," said Jack, "<i>I</i> goes by sunrise,
messmate, an' I didn't like it
overmuch myself, d'ye see! That
'ere talk o' yours, Harry, consarnin'
dazarts and what not&mdash;why, bless me,
it's all my eye,&mdash;this bout, at any
rate&mdash;seein' as how, if we doesn't have
a stiff snuffler out o' that very quarter
afore twenty-four hours is over, you
call me lubber!" "Ho, ho! old salt,"
chuckled Harry, "none o' them saws
holds good hereaway, if its the coast
of Africay&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n it, 'mate, <i>two</i>
watches 'll settle our hash in them
longitudes, without going the length
o' <i>six</i>! Han't I knocked about the
bloody coast of it six weeks at a time,
myself, let alone livin' as many months
in the woods?&mdash;so I knows the breedin'
of a turnady a cussed sight too well, not
to speak on the way the land-blink
looms afore you sights it!" "<i>Lived</i>
in them there woods, did ye?" inquired
Jack. "Ay, bo', an' a rum
rig it was too, sure enough," said
Harry; "the very same time I tould
you on, i' the Bight o' Benin." "My
eye!" exclaimed the other, "a man
never knows what he may come to.
Let's into the rights of it, Harry,
carn't ye, afore eight-bells strikes?"
"Woods!" said Harry, "I b'lieve ye,
ould ship. I see'd enough o' woods,
that time, arter all!&mdash;and 'twan't that
long agone, either&mdash;I'll not say <i>how</i>
long, but it wan't <i>last</i> v'yage. A sharp,
clinker-built craft of a schooner she
wor, I'm not goin' to give ye her right
name, but they called her the Lubber-hater,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;an'
if there wan't all sorts on
as aboard, it's blaming ye&mdash;an' a big
double-jinted man-eatin' chap of a
Yankee was our skipper, as sly as
slush&mdash;more by token, he had a wart
alongside o' one eye as made him look
two ways at ye&mdash;Job Price by name&mdash;an'
arter he'd made his fortin, I
heard he's took up a tea-total chapel
afloat on the Missishippey. She'd got
a hell of a long nose, that 'ere schooner,
so my boy we leaves everything astarn,
chase or race, I promise ye; an' as
for a blessed ould ten-gun brig what
kept a-cruising thereaway, why, we
jest got used to her, like, and al'ays
lowers our mainsail afore takin' the
wind of her, by way o' good bye, quite
perlite. 'Blowed if it warn't rum,
though, for to see the brig's white
figger'ed over the swell, rollin' under
a cloud o' canvass, sten-s'ls crowded
out alow an' aloft, as she jogged arter
us! Then she'd haul her wind and
fire a gun, an' go beating away up in
chase of some other craft, as caught
the chance for runnin' out whenever
they sees the Lubber-hater well to
sea&mdash;why, s'elp me Bob, if the traders
on the coast didn't pay Job Price half
a dozen blacks a piece every trip, jist
for to play that 'ere dodge! At last,
one time, not long after I joined the
craft, what does he do but nigh-hand
loses her an' her cargo, all owin' to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>reckonin' over much on this here
traverse. Out we comes one night in
the tail of a squall, an' as soon as it
clears, there sure enough we made out
the brig, hard after us, as we thinks,&mdash;so
never a rag more Job claps on,
'cause two of his friends, ye see, was
jist outside the bar in the Noon river.
Well, bloody soon the cruiser begins
to overhaul us, as one gaff-taups'l
wouldn't do, nor yet another, till the
flying-jib and bonnets made her walk
away from them in right 'arnest,&mdash;when
slap comes a long-shot that
took the fore-topmast out of us in a
twinkling. So when the moonlight
comed out, lo an' behold, instead o'
the brig's two masts stiff and straight
against the haze, there was <i>three</i>
spanking sticks all ataunto, my boy,
in a fine new sloop-o'-war as had fresh
came on the station&mdash;the Irish, they
called her&mdash;and a fast ship she wor.
But all said and done, the schooner
had the heels of her in aught short of
a reef-taups'l breeze,&mdash;though, as for
the other two, the sloop-o'-war picked
off both on 'em in the end." At this
point of the fellow's account, I, Ned
Collins, began to prick up my ears,
pretty sure it was the dear old Iris he
was talking of; and thought I, "Oho,
my mate, we shall have you directly,&mdash;listening's
fair with a chap of this
breed."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "'twas the next
trip after that, we finds the coast clear,
as commonly was&mdash;for, d'ye see, they
couldn't touch us if so be we hadn't a
slave aboard,&mdash;in fact, we heerd as
how the cruiser was up by Serry Lony,
and left some young lufftenant or
other on the watch with a sort o'
lateen-rigged tender. A precious raw
chap he was, by all accounts,&mdash;and
sure enough, there he kept plying off
and on, inshore, 'stead of out of sight
to seaward till the craft would make
a bolt; an' as soon as ye dropped an
anchor, he'd send a boat aboard with
a reefer, to ax if ye'd got slaves in the
hold. In course, ye know, Job Price
sends back a message, "palm-ile an'
iv'ry, an' gould if we can,"&mdash;h'ists the
Portingee colours, brings up his Portingee
papers, and makes the Portingee
stoo'rd skipper for the spell,&mdash;but
anyhow, bein' no less nor three slavers
in the mouth of the Bonny river at
the time, why, he meant to show fight
if need be, and jest manhandle the
young navy sprig to his heart's content.
Hows'ever, the second or third
night, all on a suddent we found he'd
sheered off for decency's sake, as it
might be, an hour or two afore we'd
began to raft off the niggers. Well,
'mate, right in the midst of it there
comes sich a fury of a turnady off the
land, as we'd to slip cable and run
fair out to sea after the other craft
what had got sooner full,&mdash;one on 'em
went ashore in sight, an' we not
ninety blacks aboard yet, with barely
a day's water stowed in. The next
morning, out o' sight of land, we got
the sea-breeze, and stood in again
under everything, till we made Fernandy Po
ileyand three leagues off,
or thereby, an' the two ebony-brigs
beating out in company,&mdash;so the skipper
stands over across their course
for to give them a hail, heaves to and
pulls aboard the nearest, where he
stays a good long spell and drinks a
stiff glass, as ye may fancy, afore
partin'. Back comes Job Price in
high glee, and tould the mate as how
that mornin' the brigs had fell foul o'
the man-o'-war tender, bottom up,
an' a big Newfoundling dog a-howlin'
on the keel&mdash;no doubt she'd turned
the turtle in that 'ere squall&mdash;more by
token he brought the dog alongst
with him in a present. So away we
filled again to go in for the Bonny
river, when the breeze fell, and
shortly arter there we was all three
dead becalmed, a couple o'miles betwixt
us, sticking on the water like
flies on glass, an' as hot, ye know, as
blazes&mdash;the very moral o' this here.
By sundown we hadn't a drop o'
water, so the skipper sent to the
nearest brig for some; but strike me
lucky if they'd part with a bucketful
for love, bein' out'ard bound. As
the Spanish skipper said, 'twas either
hard dollars or a stout nigger, and
t'other brig said the same. A slight
puff o' land-wind we had in the night,
though next day 'twas as calm as
ever, and the brigs farther off&mdash;so by
noon, my boy, for two blessed casks,
if Job Price hadn't to send six blacks
in the boat. Shorter yarn, Jack,&mdash;but
the calm held that night too, and
'blowed if the brigs would sell another
breaker&mdash;what we had we couldn't
spare to the poor devils under hatches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
and the next day, why, they died off
like rotten sheep, till we hove the last
on 'em o'board; and frightful enough
it was, mind ye, for to see about fifty
sharks at work all round the schooner
at once, as long as it lasted. Well,
in the arternoon we'd just commenced
squabbling aboard amongst ourselves,
round the dreg water, or whether to
board one o' the brigs and have a fair
fight, when off come a bit of a breeze,
betwixt the two high peaks on Fernandy
Po, both the brigs set stensails,
and begins slipping quietly off&mdash;our
skipper gave orders to brace after
them, and clear away the long gun
amidships; but all on a suddent we
made out a lump of a brig dropping
down before it round the ileyand,
which we knowed her well enough for
a Bristol craft as had lost half her
hands up the Callebar, in the gould
an' iv'ry trade. Down she comed,
wonderfle fast, for the light breeze, if
there hadn't been one o' yer currents
besides off the ileyand, till about half-a-mile
away she braces up, seemingly
to sheer across it and steer clear of us.
Out went our boat, an' the skipper bids
every man of her crew to shove a
short cutlash inside his trousers.
Says he, "I guess we'll first speak 'em
fair, but if we don't ha' water enough,
it'll be 'tarnal queer, that's all," says
he&mdash;an' Job was a man never swore,
but he <i>looked</i> mighty <i>bad</i>, that time,
I must say; so we out oars and pulls
right aboard the trader, without answerin'
ever a hail, when up the side
we bundled on deck, one arter the
other, mad for a drink, and sees the
master with five or six of a crew, all
as white as ghostesses, and two or
three Kroomen, besides a long-legged
young feller a-sittin' and kicking his
feet over the kimpanion-hatch, with a
tumblerful o' grog in his fist, as fresh
to all seemin' as a fish, like a supper-cargo
or some'at o' the sort, as them
craft commonly has. "What schooner's
that?" axes the master, all abroad
like; an' says Job, says he out o'
breath, "Never you mind; I guess
you'll let's have some water, for we
wants it almighty keen!" "Well,
says the other, shaking his head,
"I'm afeared we're short ourselves&mdash;anyhow,"
says he, "we'll give ye a
dipper the piece,"&mdash;and accordingly
they fists us along a dozen gulps,
hand over hand. "'Twon't do, I
guess, mister," says our skipper; "we
wants a cask!" Here the master o'
the brig shakes his head again, and
giv a look to the young 'long-shore-like
chap aft, which sings out as we
couldn't have no more for love nor
money,&mdash;an' I see Cap'en Price commence
for to look savitch again, and
feel for the handle on his cutlash.
"Rather you'd ax iv'ry or gould-dust!"
sings out the supper-cargo&mdash;"hows'ever,"
says he: "as ye've
tooken sich a fancy to it, short o'
water as we is, why a fair exchange
an't no robbery," says he: "you
wants water, an' we wants hands;
haven't ye a couple o' niggers for to
spare us, sir, by way off a barter, now?"
he says. Well,'mate, I'll be blowed
if I ever see a man turn so wicked
fur'ous as Job Price turns at this
here,&mdash;an' says he, through his teeth,
"If ye'd said a nigger's nail-parin', I
couldn't done it, so it's no use talkin'."
"Oh come, capting," says the young
fellow, wonderfle angshis like, "say
<i>one</i> jist&mdash;it's all on the quiet, ye
know. Bless me, captin," says he,
"I'd do a deal for a man in a strait,
'tickerly for yerself&mdash;an' I think we'd
manage with a single hand more.
I'll give ye two casks and a bag o'
gould-dust for <i>one</i> black, and we'll
send aboard for him just now, ourselves!"
"No!" roars Job Price,
walkin' close up to him; "ye've riz
me, ye cussed Britisher ye, an' I tell
ye we'll <i>take</i> what we wants!" "No
jokes, though, captin!" says the feller&mdash;"what's
<i>one</i> to a whole raft-ful I heerd
of ye shipping?" "Go an' ax
the sharks, ye beggar!" says the
skipper;&mdash;"here my lads!" says he,
an' makes grab at the other's throat,
when slap comes a jug o' rum in his
eye-lights, and the young chap ups
fist in quick-sticks, and drops him
like a cock, big as he was. By that
time, though, in a twinklin', the
master was flat on deck, and the
brig's crew showed no fight&mdash;when lo
an' behold, my boy, up bundles a
score o' strapping men-o'-war's-men
out of the cabin. One or two on
us got a cut about the head, an'
my gentleman supper-cargo claps a
pistol to my ear from aft, so we
knocked under without more to do.
In five minutes time everyman jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
of us had a seizing about his wrists
and lower pins,&mdash;and says Job Price,
in a givin-up sort o' v'ice, 'You're
too cust spry for playin' jokes on, I
calc'late, squire,' he says. 'Jokes!'
says the young feller, 'why, it's no
joke&mdash;in course you knows me?'
'Niver see'd ye atween the eyes afore,'
says Job, 'but don't bear no malice,
mister, now.' 'That's it,' says the
t'other, lookin' at the schooner again,&mdash;'no
more I does&mdash;so jist think a
bit, han't you really a nigger or so
aboard o' ye&mdash;if it was <i>jist</i> one?'
'Squash the one!' says Job, shakin'
his head nellicholly like&mdash;an' 'Sorry
for it,' says the chap, ''cause ye see
I'm the lufftenant belongin' to the
Irish, an' I carn't titch yer schooner
if so be ye han't a slave aboard.'
'Lawk a'mighty!&mdash;no!' sings out
Job Price, 'cause bein' half blinded he
couldn't ha' noted the lot o' man-o'-war's-men
sooner.&mdash;'But I <i>can</i>,' says
the other, 'for piratecy, ye see; an'
what's more,' he says, 'there's no help
for it now, I'm afeared, mister what-they-call-ye!'
Well, 'mate, after that
ye may fancy our skipper turns terrible
down in the mouth; so without a
word more they parbuckles us all
down below into the cabin&mdash;an' what
does this here lufftenant do but he
strips the whole lot, rigs out as many
of his men in our duds, hoists out a
big cask o' water on the brig's far
side, and pulls round for the schooner,&mdash;hisself
togged out like the skipper,
and his odd hands laid down in the
boat's bottom." You won't wonder
at my being highly amused with the
fellow's yarn, since the fact was that
it happened to be one of my own
adventures in the days of the Iris,
two or three years before, when we
saw a good many scenes together, far
more, wild and stirring, of course, in
the thick of the slave-trade; but
really the ugly rascal described it
wonderfully well.</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry, "I gets my
chin shoved up in the starn-windy,
where I see'd the whole thing, and
tould the skipper accordently. The
schooner's crew looked out for the
water like so many oysters in a tub;
the lufftenant jumps up the side with
his men after him, an' not so much as
the cross of two cutlashes did we
hear afore the onion-jack flew out
a-peak over her mains'l. In five
minutes more, the schooner fills
away before the breeze, and begins
to slide off in fine style after the pair
o' brigs, as was nigh half hull-down
to seaward by this time. There we
was, left neck an' heel below in the
trader, and he hauled up seemin'ly for
the land,&mdash;an' arter a bit says the
skipper to me, 'Foster, my lad, I
despise this way o' things,' says he,
'an't there no way on gettin' clear?'
'Never say die, cap'en!' I says; an'
says he, 'I calc'late they left considerable
few hands aboard?' 'None
but them sleepy-like scum o' iv'ry
men,' I says,&mdash;but be blowed if I
see'd what better we was, till down
comes a little nigger cabin-boy for
some'at or other, with a knife in his
hand. Job fixes his eye on him&mdash;I've
heerd he'd a way in his eye with
niggers as they couldn't stand&mdash;an'
says he, soft-sawderin' like, 'Come
here, will ye, my lad, an' give us a
drink,'&mdash;so the black come for'ad with
a pannikin, one foot at a time, an' he
houlds it out to the skipper's lips&mdash;for,
d'ye see, all on us had our flippers
lashed behind our backs. 'Now,'
says he, 'thankee, boy,&mdash;look in
atwixt my legs, and ye'll find a dollar.'
With that, jest as the boy stoops,
Job Price ketches his neck fast betwixt
his two knees, an' blowed if he
didn't jam them harder, grinning all
the time, till down drops the little
black throttled on the deck. 'That's
for thankin' a bloody niggur!' says
he, lookin' as savitch as the devil,
and got the knife in his teeth, when
he turned to and sawed through the
seizing round my wrists&mdash;an' in
course I sets every man clear in quick-sticks.
'<i>Now!</i>' says Job, lookin'
round, 'the quicker the better&mdash;that
cussed lubber-ratin' hound's got my
schooner, but maybe, my lads, this
here iv'ry man'll pay expenses&mdash;by
th'almighty, if I'm made out a pirate,
I'll arn the name!'</p>

<p>"Well, we squints up the hatchway,
and see'd a young midshipman
a-standing with his back to us,
watching the brig's crew at the braces,
an' a pistol in one hand&mdash;when all at
once our skipper slips off his shoes,
run up the stair as quiet as a cat, an'
caught the end of a capstan-bar as
lay on the scuttle. With that down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
he comes crash on the poor fellow's
scull from aft, and brained him in a
moment. Every man of us got
bloody-minded with the sight, so we
scarce knowed what we did, ye know,
'mate, afore all hands o' them was
gone,&mdash;how, I an't goin' for to say,
nor the share as one had in it more
nor another. The long an' the short
on it was, we run the brig by sundown
in amongst the creeks up the
Camaroons river, thinkin' to lie stowed
away close thereabouts till all wor
cold. Hows'ever they kicked up the
devil's delight about a piratecy, and
the sloop-o'war comes back shortly,
when night an' day there was that
young shark of a lufftenant huntin'
arter us, as sharp as a marlinspike&mdash;we
dursn't come down the river
nohow, till what with a bad conscience,
fogs, and sleepin' every night
within stink o' them blasted muddy
mangroves an' bulrushes together,
why, mate, the whole ten hands died
off one arter the other in the fever&mdash;leaving
ownly me an' the skipper.
Job Price was like a madman over
the cargo, worth, good knows how
many thousand dollars, as he couldn't
take out&mdash;but for my part, I gets the
brig's punt one night and sculls myself
ashore, and off like a hare into the
bush by moonlight. No use, ye
know, for to say what rum chances I
meets with in the woods, livin' up
trees and the like for fear o' illiphants,
sarpents, an' bloody high-annies,&mdash;but,
blow me, if I didn't think the
farther ye went aloft, the more
monkeys an' parrykeets you rowsed
out, jabberin' all night so as a feller
couldn't close an eye&mdash;an' as for
the sky, be blowed if I ever once
sighted it. So, d'ye see, it puts all
notions o' fruits an' flowers out o'
my head, an' all them jimmy-jessamy
sort o' happy-go-lucky yarns about
barbers' ileyands and shipherdresses
what they used for to spell out o'
dicshinars at school&mdash;all gammon,
mate!" "Lord love ye, no, surely,"
said Jack; "it's in the Bible!"
"Ay, ay," said Harry, "that's
arter ye've gone to Davy Jones,
no doubt; but I've been in the
South-Sy ileyands since, myself, an'
be blowed if it's much better there!
Hows'ever, still anon, I took a new
fancy, an' away I makes for the river,
in sarch of a nigger villache, as they
calls 'em; and sure enough it warn't
long ere right I plumps in the midst
on a lot o' cane huts amongst trees.
But sich a shine and a nitty as I kicks
up, ye see, bein' half naked, for all the
world like a wild man o' the woods,
an' for a full hour I has the town to
myself, so I hoists my shirt on a stick
over the hut I took, by way of a flag
o' truce, an' at last they all begins for
to swarm in again. Well, ye see, I
knowed the ways o' the natifs thereabouts
pretty well, an' what does I do
but I'd laid myself flat afore a blasted
ugly divvle of a wooden himmache, as
stood on the flour, an' I wriggles and
twists myself, and groans like a chap
in a fit&mdash;what they calls <i>fittish</i>, thereaway&mdash;an'
in course, with that they
logs me down at once for a rig'lar
holy-possel from Jerusalem. The
long an' the short on it was, the fittish-man
takes me under charge, and
sets me to tell fortins or the like with
an ould quadrant they'd got somewheres&mdash;gives
me a hut an' two
black wives, begad! and there I lives
for two or three weeks on end, no
doubt, as proud as Tommy&mdash;when, one
fine morning, what does I see off shore
in the river but that confounded man-o'-war
tender, all ship-shape an'
ataunto again. So, my boy, I gives
'em to understand as how, bein' over
vallible at home with the King of
England, in course he'd sent for to
puckalow me away&mdash;an' no sooner
said, but the whole town gets in a
fluster&mdash;the fittish-man, which a knowing
chap <i>he</i> was, takes an' rubs me
from heel to truck with ile out on a
sartain nut, as turned me coal-black
in half an hour, an' as soon as I looks
in the creek, 'mate, be blowed if I'd a
knewn myself from a nigger, somehow!"
To tell the truth, as <i>I</i> thought
to myself, it was no wonder, as Master
Harry's nose and lips were by no
means in the classic style, and his
skin, as it was, didn't appear of the
whitest. "So there, ye know, I sits
before a hut grindin' away at maize,
with nothink else but a waist-cloth
round me, and my two legs stuck out,
till such time as the lufftenant an' two
boats' crews had sarched the villache,
havin' heerd, no doubt, of a white
man thereabouts&mdash;an' at last off they
went. Well, in course, at first this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
here affair gives the fittish-man a lift
in the niggerses eyes, by reason o'
havin' turned a white man black&mdash;'cause,
ye see, them fittish-men has a
riglar-bred knowledge on plants and
sichlike. But hows'ever, in a day or
two I begins for to get rayther oneasy,
seein' it didn't wash off, an' accordently
I made beknown as much to the
fittish-man, when, my boy, if he
doesn't shake his mop-head, and rubs
noses, as much as to say, 'We an't
agoin' to part.' 'Twas no use, and
thinks I, 'Ye man-eatin' scum, be
blowed if I don't put your neck out,
then!' So I turns to with my knife
on a log o' wood, carves a himmage
twice as big an' ugly as his'n, and
builds a hut over it, where I plays all
the conjerin' tricks I could mind on&mdash;till,
be hanged if the niggers didn't
begin to leave the fittish-man pretty
fast, an' make a blessed sight more o'
me. I takes a couple more wives,
gets drunk every day on palm-wine
and toddy-juice&mdash;as for the hogs an'
the yams they brought me, why I
couldn't stow 'em away; an' in place
o' wantin' myself white again, I rubs
myself over an' over with that ere
nut, let alone palm-ile, till the bloody
ould fittish-man looks brown alongside
o' me. At last the king o' the niggers
thereaway&mdash;King Chimbey they called
him, or some'at o' the sort&mdash;he sends
for to see me, an' away to his town
they takes me, a mile or two up the
country, where I see'd him; but I'm
blowed, Jack, if he'd got a crown on
at all, ounly a ould red marine's coat,
an' a pair o' top-boots, what was laid
away when he warn't in state. Hows'ever
he gives me two white beans an'
a red un, in sign o' high favour, and
gives me to know as I wor to stay
there. But one thing I couldn't make
out, why the black king's hut an' the
josst-house, as they calls it, was all
stuck round with bones an' dead men's
skulls!&mdash;'twan't long, though, ere I
finds it out, 'mate! That ere fittish-man,
d'ye see, wor a right-down imp
to look at, and devilish wicked he
eyed me; but still anon I sends over
for my wives, turns out a black feller
out on his hut, an' slings a hammock
in it, when the next day or so I meets
the first fittish-man in the woods, an'
the poor divvle looks wonderfle
friendly-like, makin' me all kinds o'
woeful signs, and seemin'ly as much
as to say for to keep a bright look-out
on the other. All on a suddent what
does he do, but he runs a bit, as far
as a tree, picks up a sort of a red
mushroom, an' he rubs with it across
the back o' my hand, gives a wink,
and scuttles off. What it meaned I
couldn't make out, till I gets back to
the town, when I chanced to look at
my flipper, and there I see a clean
white streak alongst it! Well, I
thinks, liberty's sweet, an' I'm blessed
if a man's able to cruize much to
windward o' right-down slavery,
thinks I, if he's black! Howsomever,
thinks I, I'll jest hold on a <i>bit</i> longer.
Well, next day, the black king had
the blue-devils with drinkin' rum,
an' he couldn't sleep nohow, 'cause, as
I made out, he'd killed his uncle, they
said&mdash;I doesn't know but he'd eaten
him, too&mdash;anyhow, I see'd him eat as
much of a fat hog, raw, as ud sarve
out half the watch&mdash;so the fittish-man
tells him there's nought for it but to
please the fittish. What that wor,
blowed if I knew; but no sooner sundown
nor they hauls me out o' my
hut, claps me in a stinking hole as
dark as pitch, and leaves me to smell
hell till mornin', as I thought. Jist
about the end o' the mid-watch, there
kicks up a rumpus like close-reef
taups'ls in a hurricane&mdash;smash goes
the sticks over me; I seed the stars,
and a whole lot o' strange blacks
with long spears, a-fightin', yellin',
tramplin', an' twistin' in the midst
o' the huts,&mdash;and off I'm hoisted in
the gang, on some feller's back or
other, at five knots the hour, through
the woods,&mdash;till down we all comes in
a drove, plash amongst the very
swamps close by the river, where, lo
an' behold, I makes out a schooner
afloat at her anchor. The next thing
I feels a blasted red-hot iron come
hiss across my shoulders, so I jumped
up and sang out like blazes, in course.
But, my flippers bein' all fast, 'twas
no use: I got one shove as sent me
head-foremost into a long canoe, with
thirty or forty niggers stowed away
like cattle, and out the men pulls for
the schooner. A big bright fire there
was ashore, astarn of us, I mind,
where they heated the irons, with a
chap in a straw hat sarvin' out rum
to the wild blacks from a cask; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
ye saw the pitch-black woods behind,
with the branches shoved out red in
the light on it, an' a bloody-like patch
on the water under a clump o' sooty
mangrooves. An' be d&mdash;d, Jack, if
I didn't feel the life sick in me, that
time&mdash;for, d'ye see, I hears nothin'
spoke round me but cussed French,
Portingeese, an' nigger tongue&mdash;'specially
when it jist lightens on me what
sort on a case I were in; an' thinks I,
'By G&mdash;if I'm not took for a <i>slave</i>,
arter all!&mdash;an' be hanged but I left that
'ere, 'farnal mushroom a-lying under
that there tree yonder!' I begins for to
think o' matters an' things, an' about
Bristol quay, an' my old mother, an'
my sister as was at school&mdash;mind ye,
'mate, all atwixt shovin' off the mangroves
an' coming bump again the
schooner's side&mdash;an' blow me if I
doesn't tarn to, an' nigh-hand commences
for to blubber&mdash;when jist then
what does I catch sight on, by the lantern
over the side, but that 'ere villain
of a fittish-man, an' what's more,
King Chimbey hisself, both hauled in
the net. And with that I gives a
chuckle, as ye may suppose, an' no
mistake; for, thinks I, so far as consarns
myself, this here can't last long,
blow me, for sooner or later I'll find
some un to speak to, even an I niver
gets rid o' this here outer darkness&mdash;be
blowed if I han't got a white mind,
any ways, an' free I'll be, my boy!
But I laughs, in course, when I see'd
the fittish-man grin at me,&mdash;for thinks
I, my cocks, you're logged down for
a pretty long spell of it!"</p>

<p>"Well, bo', somehow I knows no
more about it till such time as I sort
o' wakes up in pitch-dark, all choke
and sweat, an' a feller's dirty big toe
in my mouth, with mine in some un
else's eye,&mdash;so out I spits it, an' makes
scramble for my life. By the roll an'
the splash, I knowed I wor down in
the schooner's hold; an' be hanged if
there wan't twenty or thirty holding
on like bees to a open weather-port,
where the fresh wind and the spray
come a-blowing through&mdash;but there,
my boy, 'twere no go for to get so
much as the tip o' yer nose. Accordently,
up I prizes myself with my
feet on another poor devil's wool,&mdash;for,
d'ye see, by that time I minds a
man's face no more nor so much timber!&mdash;an'
I feels for the hatch over me,
where by good luck, as I thought,
there I finds it not battened down
yet, so I shoved my head through on
deck like a blacksmith's hammer.
Well, 'mate, there was the schooner's
deck wet, a swell of a sea on round
her, well off the land, no trifle of a
morning gale, and the craft heeling to
it&mdash;a lot o' hands up on her yards,
a-reefing at the boom mains'l and
fo'taups'l, an' begod if my heart
doesn't jump into my mouth with the
sight, for I feels it for all the world
like a good glass o' grog, settin' all to
rights. Two or three there was walkin'
aft the quarterdeck, so out I sings
'Hullo! hullo there, shipmates, give
us a hand out o' this!' Two on 'em
comes forud, one lifts a handspike,
but both gives a grin, as much as to
say it's some nigger tongue or other,
in place o' good English&mdash;for, d'ye see,
they'd half their faces black-beard,
and rings i' their ears&mdash;when up walks
another chap like the skipper, an'
more the looks of a countryman.
'D&mdash;n it,' roars I again, 'I'm a
free-born Briton!' with that he lends
me a squint, looks to the men, an'
gives some sort o' a sign&mdash;when they
jams-to the hatch and nips me fast by
the neck. 'Devil of a deep beggar,
this here!' says he; 'jist, give him the
gag, my lads,' says he; 'the planters
often thinks more of a dumby, 'cause
he works the more, and a stout piece
o' goods this <i>is</i>!' says he. Well, 'mate,
what does they do but one pulls out
a knife, an' be blowed if they warn't
agoin' for to cut out my tongue; but
the men aloft sung out to hoist away
the yards; so they left me ready
clinched till they'd belay the ropes.
Next, a hand forud, by good luck,
hailed 'Sail-O,' and they'd some'at
else to think o' besides me; for there,
my boy, little more nor three miles
to wind'ard, I see'd the Irish as she
come driving bodily out o' the mist,
shakin' out her three to'gallant-sails,
an' a white spray flying with her off
one surge to another. Bloody bad it
was, mind ye, for my wind-pipe, for
every time the schooner pitched,
away swings my feet clear o' the nigger's
heads,&mdash;'cause, d'ye see, we
chanced for to be stowed on the 'tween-decks,
an' another tier there was, stuffed
in her lower hold&mdash;an' there I stuck,
'mate, so as I couldn't help watchin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
the whole chase, till at last the hatch
slacks nip a bit, and down I plumps
into the dark again."</p>

<p>"Well, bo', the breeze got lighter,
an' to all seemin' the cursed schooner
held her own; but hows'ever, the sloop-o'-war
kept it up all day, and once
or twice she tips us a long shot; till
by sunset, as I reckoned, we hears no
more on her. The whole night long,
again, there we stews as thick as peas&mdash;I
keeps harknin' to the sighs an'
groans, an' the wash along the side,
in a sort of a doze; an' s'help me Bob,
I fancies for a moment I'm swinging
in my hammock in the fox'sle, an' it's
no more but the bulkheads and timbers
creakin'. Then I thinks its some
un else I dreams on, as is d&mdash;d oneasy,
like to choke for heat and thirst;
an' I'm a-chuckling at him&mdash;when up
I wakes with the cockroaches swarming
over my face. Another groan runs
from that end to this, the whole lot
on us tries hard, and kicks their neighbours
to turn, an' be blowed if I
knowed but I was buried in a churchyard,
with the blasted worms all acrawl
about me. All on a sudden,
nigh-hand to daybreak it was, I
hears a gun to wind'ard, so with that
I contrives for to scramble up with
my eye to the scuttle-port. 'Twas a
stiffish breeze, an' I see'd some'at lift
on a sea, like a albatrosse's wing, as
one may say&mdash;though what wor this
but the Irish's bit of a tender, standing
right across our bows&mdash;for the
schooner, ye see, changed her course i'
the night-time, rig'lar slaver's dodge,
thinkin' for to drop the sloop-o'-war,
sure enough. But as for the
little f'lucca, why, they hadn't
bargained for her at all, lying-to as
she did, with a rag o' sail up, in the
troughs of the sea, till the schooner was
close on her. Well, no sooner does
they go about, my boy, but the muskeety
of a cruiser lets drive at her off
the top of a sea, as we hung broadside
to them in stays. Blessed if I ever
see sich a mark!&mdash;the shot jist takes
our fore-top fair slap&mdash;for the next
minute I see'd the fore-topmast come
over the lee-side, an' astarn we begins
to go directly. What's more, mate, I
never see a small craft yet handled
better in a sea, as that 'ere chap did&mdash;nor
the same thing done, cleaner at
any rate&mdash;for they jist comes nigh-hand
tip on our bowsprit-end, as the
schooner lifted&mdash;then up in the wind
they went like clock-work, with a
starnway on as carried the f'lucca,
right alongside on us, like a coachman
backing up a lane, and <i>grind</i> we both
heaved on the swell, with the topmast
hamper an' its canvass for a
fender atwixt us. Aboard jumps the
man-o'-war's-men, in course, cutlash
in hand, an' for five minutes some
tough work there was on deck, by the
tramp, the shots, an' the curses over
our heads&mdash;when off they shoved the
hatches, and I see'd a tall young feller
in a gold-banded cap look below. Be
blowed if I wasn't goin' to sing out
again, for, d'ye see, I'm blessed if I
took mind on the chap at all, as much
by reason o' the blood an' the smoke
he'd got on his face as aught else.
Hows'ever, I holds a bit meantime, on
account o' Job Price an' that 'ere
piratecy consarn&mdash;till what does I
think, a hour or two arter, when I
finds as this here were the very lufftenant
as chased us weeks on end in
the Camaroons. So a close stopper,
sure enough, I keeps on my jaw; an'
as for scentin' me out amongst a
couple o' hundred blacks in the hold,
why, 'twere fit to Paul my own mother
herself.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, by this time bein'
near Serry Lone, next day or so we
got in&mdash;where, what does they do but
they <i>lubber-rates</i> us all, as they calls
it, into a barracoon ashore, till sich
time as the slaver ud be condemned&mdash;an'
off goes the tender down coast
again. Arter that, they treats us well
enough, but still I dursn't say a word;
for one day, as we goed to work makin'
our huts, there I twigs a printed bill
upon the church-wall, holdin' out a
reward, d'ye see, consarnin' the piratecy,
with my oun name and my
very build logged down&mdash;ownly, be
hanged if they doesn't tack on to it all,
byway of a topgallant ink-jury to a
man, these here words&mdash;'He's a very
ugly feller&mdash;looks like a furriner.'
Well, mate, I an't a young maiden,
sure enough&mdash;but, thinks I, afore I fell
foul o' that blasted fittish-man an' his
nut, cuss me if I looks jist so bad as
that 'ere! So ye know this goes more
to my heart nor aught else, till there
I spells out another confounded lie in
the bill, as how Cap'en Price's men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
had mutinied again him, and murdered
the brig's crew&mdash;when, in course, I sees
the villain's whole traverse at once. So
seein' I watched my chance one night,
an' went aboard of a Yankee brig as
were to sail next day; an' I tells the
skipper part o' the story, offerin' for
to work my passage across for nothin'&mdash;which,
says he, 'It's a hinteresstin'
narritife'&mdash;them was his words;
an' says he, 'It's a land o' freedom is
the States, an' no mistake&mdash;an't there
no more on ye in the like case?' he
says. 'Not as I knows on, sir,' I
answers; an' says he, 'Plenty o'
coloured gen'lmen there is yonder, all
in silks an' satins; an' I hear,' says
he, 'there's one on 'em has a chance
o' bein President next time&mdash;anyhow
I'm your friend,' says he, quite
hearty. Well, the long an' short of
it was, I stays aboard the brig, works
my spell in her, an' takes my trick at
the helm&mdash;but I'm blowed, Jack, if
the men ud let me sleep in the fok'sle,
'cause I was a black,&mdash;so I slung my
hammock aft with the nigger stoo'rd.
D'ye see, I misgived myself a bit
when we sank the coast, for thinks I
its in Africay as that 'ere blessed
mushroom are to be found, to take
the colour off me&mdash;hows'ever, I thinks
it carn't but wear out in time, now
I've got out o' that 'ere confounded
mess, where, sure enough, things was
against me&mdash;so at last the v'yage were
up, an' the brig got in to New Orleens.
There I walks aft to the skipper for
to take leave, when says he, wonderfle
friendly-like,&mdash;'Now my lad,'
says he, 'I'm goin' up river a bit for
to see a friend as takes a interesst in
your kind&mdash;an' if ye likes, why, I'll
pay yer passage that far?' In course
I agrees, and up river we goes, till we
lands at a fine house, where I'm left
in a far-handy, ye know, while the
skipper an' his friend has their dinner.
All at once the gen'lman shoves his
head out of a doure, takes a look at
me, an' in again,&mdash;arter that I hears
the chink o' dollars&mdash;then the skipper
walks out, shuts the doure, an' says
he to me, 'Now,' he says, 'that's a
'cute sort o' tale you tould me, my
lad&mdash;but it's a lie, I guess!' 'Lie,
sir!' says I, 'what d'ye mean?' for
ye see that 'ere matter o' the iv'ry
brig made me sing small, at first.
'No slack, Pumpey,' says he, liftin'
his fore-finger like a schoolmaster,&mdash;ain't
yer name Pumpey?' says he.
'Pumpey be d&mdash;&mdash;d!' says I, 'my
name's Jack Brown'&mdash;for that wor
the name, I'd gived him, afore. 'Oh!'
says he, 'jest say it's Gin'ral Washinton,
right off! Come,' says he, 'I
guess I'd jest tell ye what tripe you
belongs to&mdash;you're a Mandingy niggur,'
says he. 'It's all very well,' he
says, 'that 'ere yarn, but that's wot
they'd all say when they comes,
they've been dyed black! Why,' says
he, 'doesn't I see that 'ere brand one
night on yer back&mdash;there's yer arms
all over pagan tattooin'&mdash;' 'Bless
ye, cap'en,' I says, a-holdin' up my
arm, 'it's crowns an' anchers!'
'Crowns!' says he, turnin' up his
nose, 'what does we know o' crowns
hereaway&mdash;<i>we</i> ain't barbers yet,
I guess.'&mdash;Of what he meaned by
<i>barbers</i> here, mate, I'm hanged if I
knowed&mdash;'sides,' says he, 'you
speaks broken Aimerricane!' 'Merricain?'
I says, 'why, I speaks good
English! an' good reason, bein' a free-born
Briton&mdash;as white's yerself, if so
be I could ownly clap hands for a
minnet on some o' them mushrooms I
tould ye on!' 'Where does they
grow, then?' axes he, screwin' one
eye up. 'In Africay yonder, sir,' I
says, 'more's the pity I hadn't the
chance to lay hands on 'em again!'
'Phoo!' says he, 'glad they ain't
<i>here</i>! An does you think we're agoin'
for to send all the way over to Africay
for them mushrooms you talks on?
Tell ye what, yer free papers 'ud do
ye a sight more good <i>here</i>!' says he&mdash;'its
no use, with a black skin, for to
claim white laws; an' what's more,
ye're too tarnation ugly-faced for it,
let alone colour, Pumpey, my man!'
he says. 'I tell ye what it is, Cap'en
Edwards,' says I, 'my frontispiece
an't neither here nor there, but if you
calls me Pumpey again, 'blowed an'
I don't pitch inty ye!'&mdash;so with that
I handles my bones in a way as
makes him hop inside the doure&mdash;an'
says the skipper, houldin' it
half shut, 'Harkee, lad,' he says,
'it's no go your tryin' for to run,
or they'll make ye think angels o'
bo'sun's-mates. But what's more,'
says he, 'niver you whisper a word
o' what ye tells me, about nuts an'
mushrooms, or sichlike trash&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
more will I; for d'ye see, my lad, in
that case they'd jest <i>hush ye up</i> for
good!' 'Who d'ye mean!' I says, all
abroad, an' of a shiver, like&mdash;mindin'
on the slave-schooner again. 'Why,
the planter's people,' says he, 'as I've
sold ye to;' an' with that he p'ints
into his mouth, and shuts the door.
Well, 'mate, ye may fancy how I feels!
Here I stands, givin' a look round for
a fair offing; but there was bulwarks
two-fadom high all round the house,
a big bloodhound chained, with his
muzzle on his two paws, an' nobody
seems for to mind me. So I see'd it
were all up wonst more; an' at the
thou't of a knife in my tongue, I sits
right down in the far-handy, rig'lar
flabbergasted,&mdash;when out that 'ere
blasted skipper shoots his head again,
an' says he 'Pumpey, my lad, good
day,' says he; 'you knows some'at o'
the water, an' as they've boat-work at
times hereaway, I don't know but, if
you behaves yerself, they'll trust you
with an oar now an' then; for I tould
yer master jist now,' says he, 'as how
you carn't speak no English!' Well,
I gives him a damn, 'cause by that
time I hadn't a word to throw at a
dog; an' shortly arter, up comes the
overseer with his black mate, walks
me off to a shed, strips me, and gives
me a pair o' cotton drawers an' a
broad hat&mdash;so out I goes the next
mornin' for to hoe sugar-cane with a
gang o' niggers.</p>

<p>"Well, 'mate, arter that I kept
close enough&mdash;says no more but mumbles
a lot o' no-man's jargon, as makes
'em all log me down for a sort o'
double-guinea savitch&mdash;, cause why, I
were hanged afeared for my tongue,
seein', if so be I lost it, I'd be a nigger
for ever, sure enough. So the
blacks, for most part bein' country
bred, they talks nothin' but a blessed
jumble, for all the world like babbies
at home; an' what does they do but
they fancies me a rig'lar African
nigger, as proud as Tommy, an'
a'most ready for to washup me they
wor&mdash;why, the poor divvles ud bring
me yams an' fish, they kisses my
flippers an' toes as I'd been the Pope;
an' as for the young girls, I'm blowed
if I wan't all the go amongst em&mdash;though
I carn't say the same where
both 's white, ye know! What with
the sun an' the cocoa-nut ile, to my
thinkin', I gets blacker an' blacker&mdash;'blessed
if I didn't fancy a feller's very
mind tarned nigger. I larns their
confounded lingo, an' I answers to the
name o' Pumpey, blast it, till I right-down
forgets that I'd ever another.
As for runnin', look ye, I knowed 'twas
no use thereaway, as long as my skin
tould against me, an' as long as Africay
wor where it wor. So, my boy, I
see'd pretty clear, ye know, as this
here bloody world ud turn a man into
a rig'lar built slave-nigger in the long
run, if he was a angel out o' heaven!</p>

<p>"Well, 'mate, one day I'm in the
woods amongst a gang, chopping firewood
for the sugar-mill, when, by the
Lord! what does I light on betwixt
some big ground-leaves and sichlike,
but a lot o' them very same red mushrooms
as the fittish-man shows me in
Africay!&mdash;blowed if there warn't a
whole sight o' them round about, too!
So I pulls enough for ten, ye may be
sure, stuffs 'em in my hat, an' that
same night, as soon as all's dark, off
I goes into the woods, right by the
stars, for the nearest town 'twixt there
an' New Orleens. As soon as I got
nigh-hand it, there I sits down below
a tree amongst the bushes, hauls off
my slops, an' I turns to for to rub
myself all over, from heel to truck,
till daybreak. So, in course, I watches
for the light angshis enough, as ye
may suppose, to know what colour I
were. Well, strike me lucky, Jack,
if I didn't jump near a fadom i' the
air, when at last I sees I'm <i>white</i>
wonst more!&mdash;'blessed if I didn't feel
myself a new man from stem to starn!
I makes right for a creek near by,
looks at my face in the water, then up
I comes again, an' every bloody yarn
o' them cussed slave-togs I pulls to
bits, when I shoves 'em under the
leaves. Arter that I took fair to the
water for about a mile, jist to smooth
out my wake, like; then I shins aloft
up a tree, where I stowed myself
away till noon&mdash;'cause, d'ye see, I
knowed pretty well what to look for
next. An' by this time, mind ye, all
them queer haps made a feller wonderfle
sharp, so I'd schemed out the
whole chart aforehand how to weather
on them cussed Yankees. Accordently,
about noon, what does I hear
but that 'ere blasted bloodhound
comin' along up creek, with a set o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
slave-catchers astarn, for to smell out
my track. With that, down I went
in the water again, rounds a point
into the big river, where I gets
abreast of a landin'-place near the
town, with craft laying out-stream,
boats plying, an' all alive. D'ye see,
bo', I'd got no clothes at all, an' how
for to rig myself again, 'blowed if I
knows&mdash;seein' as how by this time
I'd tarned as white as the day I were
born, an' a naked white man in a
town arn't no better nor a black nigger.
So in I swims like a porpus
afore a breeze, an' up an' down I
ducks in the shallow, for all the world
like a chap a-takin' a bath; an' out I
hollers to all an' sundry, with a
Yankee twang i' my nose, for to know
if they'd see'd my clothes, till a whole
lot on 'em crowds on the quay.
Hows'ever, I bethinks me on that
'ere blasted brand atwixt my shoulders,
an' I makes myself out as modest
as a lady, kicks out my legs, and
splashes like a whale aground, an'
sticks out my starn to 'em for to let
'em see it's white. 'Hullo!' I sings
out, 'han't ye seen my clothes?'
'No, stranger,' says they, 'some un's
runned off with 'em, we calc'lates!'
With that I tells 'em I'm a Boston
skipper new comed up from New
Orleens; an' not bein' used to the
heat, why, I'd took a bath the first
thing; an' I 'scribes the whole o' my
togs as if I'd made 'em,&mdash;'split new,'
says I, 'an' a beaver hat, more by
token there's my name inside it; an''
says I, 'there's notes for a hundred
dollars in my trousers!' By this
time down comes the slave-catchers,
an' says they, hearin' on it, 'That 'ere
tarnation niggur's gone of with 'em,
we'll know un by them marks well
enough,' says they, an' off they goes
across river. 'Hullo!' I sings out to
the folks, 'I'm a gettin' cold here, so
I guess I'll come ashore again, slick
off!' I twangs out. 'Guess ye can't,
straunger!' they hails; 'not till we gets
ye some kiverin's!&mdash;we're considerable
proper here, we are!' 'An't this a free
country, then?' I says, givin' a
divvle of a splash; an' with that they
begs an' axes me for to hould on, an'
they'd fix me, as they calls it, in no
time. Well, mate, what does they do
but one an' another brings me somethin'
as like what I 'scribed as could
be, hands 'em along on a pole, an' I
puts 'em on then an' there. Arter
that, the ladies o' the place bein'
blessed modest, an' all of a fright
leest I'd a comed out an' gone through
the town,&mdash;why, out o' grannytude,
as they says, they gets up a supper-scription
on a hundred dollars to make
up my loss&mdash;has a public meetin' logged
down for the evenin', when I'm
for to indress the citizens, as they
says, all about freedom an' top-gallantry,
an' sichlike. Hows'ever, I jist
sticks my tongue in my cheek, eats
a blessed good dinner in a hot-ell,
watches my chance, an' off by a track-boat
at sundown to New Orleens,
where I shipped aboard a English
barque, an' gets safe out to sea wonst
more." "Lord love ye, Harry!" exclaimed
Jack hereupon, "the likes o'
that now! But I've heerd say, them
fittish-men you talks on has wonderful
knowledge&mdash;why, mayhap it's
them as keeps all the niggers black,
now?" "Well, bo'," said Harry, "I
don't doubt but if them 'Merricane
slaves jist knowed o' that 'ere red
mushroom, why, they'd show the Yankees
more stripes nor stars! D'ye see,
if a Yankee knowed as his own father
were a-hoein' his sugar-canes, 'blowed
if he wouldn't make him work up his
liberty in dollars! All the stripes,
d'ye see, 'mate, is for the blacks, an'
all the stars is for the whites, in them
Yankee colours as they brags so much
about! But what I says is, it's curst
hard to get through this here world,
shipmate, if ye doesn't keep well to
wind'ard of it!" I was the more
amused with this account of the ugly
rascal's adventures, that I remembered
two or three of the occasions he mentioned,
and he told them pretty exactly
so far as I had to do with them. As
for the fetish-man's curious nut, and
that extraordinary mushroom of his,
why 'ten to one' thought I, 'but
all the while the fellow never once
touched a piece of <i>soap</i>!' which, no
doubt, had as much to do with it as
anything besides. Somehow or other,
notwithstanding, I had taken almost
a fancy to the villain&mdash;such a rough
sample of mankind he was, with his
uncouth, grumpy voice and his huge
black beard; and he gave the story in
a cool, scornful sort of way that was
laughable in itself. 'So, my lad,' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
thought, 'it seems you and I have
met twice before; but if you play any
of your tricks this time, Master Harry,
I hope you've found your match;' and
certainly, if I had fancied my gentleman
was in the slaver's hold that time
off the African coast, I'd have 'lubber-rated'
him with a vengeance! "I
say, 'mates," said he again, with a
sulky kind of importance, to those of
the watch who had gathered round
during the last half of his yarn,
"there's three things I hates&mdash;an'
good reason!" "What be's they,
Harry?" asked the rest. "One's a
Yankee," said he, "an' be blowed
to him! the second's a slaver; and
the third is&mdash;I carn't abide a nigger,
nohow. But d'ye see, there's one
thing as I likes&mdash;&mdash;" Here eight
bells struck out, and up tumbled the
watch below, with Jacobs' hearty
face amongst them; so I made my
way aft, and, of course, missed hearing
what that said delightful thing
might be, which this tarry &AElig;sop approved
of so much.</p>

<p>While I was listening, I had scarcely
noticed, that within the last few minutes
a light air had begun to play
aloft among the higher canvass, a
faint cat's-paw came ruffling here and
there a patch of the water, till by this
time the Indiaman was answering
her wheel again, and moving slowly
ahead, as the breeze came down and
crept out to the leeches of her sail,
with a sluggish lifting of her heavy
fore-course. The men were all below
at breakfast, forward, and, of course,
at that hour the poop above me was
quite a Babel of idlers' voices; while
I looked into the compass and watched
the ship's head falling gradually off
from north-east-by-north, near which
it had stuck pretty close since daybreak.
The sun was brought before
her opposite beam, and such a perfect
gush of hazy white light shot from
that quarter over the larboard bulwarks,
that thereaway, in fact, there
might have been a fleet of ships, or a
knot of islands, and we none the
wiser, as you couldn't look into it at
all. The chief mate came handing a
wonderfully timid young lady down
the poop-ladder with great care, and
as soon as they were safe on the quarterdeck,
she asked with a confiding
sort of lisp, "And where are we going
<i>now</i> then, Mr Finch?" "Well,
Miss," simpered he, "wherever <i>you</i>
please, I'll be glad to conduct you!"
"Oh, but the ship I mean," replied
she, giggling prettily. "Why," said
Finch, stooping down to the binnacle,
"she heads due south-east at present,
Miss." "I <i>am so</i> glad you are going
on again!" said the young lady; "but
oh! when shall we see dear <i>land</i> once
more, Mr Finch?" "Not for more
than a week, I fear," answered the
mate, "when we arrive at the Cape
of Good Hope. But there, Miss, your
poetic feelings will be gratified, I
assure you! The hills there, I might
say, Miss Brodie," he went on, "not
to speak of the woods, are quite dramatic!
You mustn't suppose the
rough mariner, rude as he seems, Miss
Brodie, is entirely devoid of romance
in his sentiments, I hope!" and he
looked down for the twentieth time
that morning at his boots, as he
handed her down the cabin hatchway,
longing to see the Cape, no doubt.
'Much romance, as you call it, there
is in ugly Harry yonder!' thought I;
and comparing this sort of stuff, aft,
with the matter-of-fact notions before
the mast, made me the more anxious
for what might turn up in a few hours,
with this gallant first officer left in
full charge, and the captain, as I understood,
unable to leave his cot. A
good enough seaman the fellow was,
so far as your regular deep-sea work
went, which those India voyagers had
chiefly to do with then; but for aught
out of the way, or a sudden pinch, why,
the peace had just newly set them free
of their leading-strings, and here this
young mate brought his new-fangled
school navigation, forsooth, to run the
Seringapatam into some mess or
other; whereas, in a case of the kind,
I had no doubt he would prove as
helpless as a child. By this time, for
my part, all my wishes for some ticklish
adventure were almost gone,
when I thought of our feelings at the
loss of the boat, as well as the number
of innocent young creatures on
board, with Lota Hyde herself amongst
them: while here had I got myself
fairly set down for a raw griffin. Yet
neither Westwood nor I, unless it
came to the very worst, could, venture
to make himself openly useful! I was
puzzled both what to think of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
exact case, and what to do; whereas
a pretty short time in these latitudes,
as the foremast-man had said, might
finish our business altogether; indeed,
the whole look of things, somehow or
other, at that moment, had a strange
unsettled touch about it, out of which
one accustomed to those parts might
be sure some change would come.
The air, a little ago, was quite suffocating,
the heat got greater; and the
breeze, though it seemed to strengthen
aloft, at times sank quietly out of her
lower canvass like a breath drawn in,
and caught it again as quietly ere it
fell to the masts. What with the
slow huge heave of the water, as it
washed glittering past, and what with
the blue tropical sky overhead, getting
paler and paler at the horizon
astern, from fair heat&mdash;while the sunlight
and the white haze on our larboard
beam, made <i>it</i> a complete puzzle
to behold&mdash;why, I felt just like some
fellow in one of those stupid dreams
after a heavy supper, with nothing at
all in them, when you don't know how
long or how often you've dreamt it
before. Deuce the hand or foot you
can stir, and yet you've a notion of
something horrid that's sure to come
upon you. We couldn't be much
more than a hundred miles or so to
south'ard of St Helena; but we might
be two thousand miles off the land, or
we might be fifty. I had only been
once in my life near the coast thereaway,
and certainly my recollections
of it weren't the most pleasant. As
for the charts, so little was known of
it that we couldn't depend upon them;
yet there was no doubt the ship had
been all night long in a strong set of
water toward north-east, right across
her course. For my own part, I was
as anxious as any one else to reach
the Cape, and get rid of all this
cursed nonsense; for since last night,
I saw quite well by her look that
Violet Hyde would never favour me, if
I kept in her wake to the day of judgment.
There was I, too, every time I
came on deck and saw those roundhouse
doors, my heart leapt into my
throat, and I didn't know port from
starboard! But what was the odds,
that I'd have kissed the very pitch
she walked upon, when <i>she</i> wasn't for
<i>me</i>!&mdash;being deep in love don't
sharpen the faculties, neither, and the
more I thought of matters the stupider
I seemed to get. "Green Hand!"
thought I, "as Jacobs and the larboard
watch call me, it appears&mdash;why,
they're right enough! A green hand
I came afloat nine years ago, and by
Jove! though I know the sea and
what belongs to it, from sheer liking
to them, as 'twere&mdash;it seems a green
hand I'm to stick&mdash;seeing I know so
blessed little of womankind, not to
speak of that whole confounded world
ashore! With all one's schemes and
one's weather-eye, something new
always keeps turning up to show one
what an ass he is; and hang me, if I
don't begin to suppose I'm only fit for
working small traverses upon slavers
and jack-nasty-faces, after all! There's
Westwood, without troubling himself,
seems to weather upon me, with her,
like a Baltimore clipper on a Dutch
schuyt!" In short, I wanted to leave
the Seringapatam as soon as I could,
wish them all a good voyage together
away for Bombay, sit down under
Table Mountain, damn my own eyes,
and then perhaps go and travel
amongst the Hottentots by way of a
change.</p>

<p>The chief officer came aft towards
the binnacle again, with a strut in his
gait, and more full of importance than
ever, of course. "This breeze'll
hold, I think, Macleod?" said he to
the second mate, who was shuffling
about in a lounging, unseamanlike
way he had, as if he felt uncomfortable
on the quarterdeck, and both
hands in his jacket pockets. "Well,"
said the Scotchman, "do ye not think
it's too early begun, sir?" and he
looked about like an old owl, winking
against the glare of light past the
mainsheet to larboard; "I'll not say
but it will, though," continued he,
"but 'odsake, sir, it's terrible warm!"
"Can't be long ere we get into Cape
Town, now," said the mate, "so
you'll turn the men on deck as soon
as breakfast's over, Mr Macleod, and
commence giving her a coat of paint
outside, sir." "Exactly, Mr Finch,"
said the other, "all hands it'll be,
sir? For any sake, Mr Finch, give
thay lazy scoundrels something ado!"
"Yes, all hands," said Finch; and he
was going below, when the second
mate sidled up to him again, as if he
had something particular to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
"The captain'll be quite better by
this time, no doubt, Mr Finch?"
asked he. "<i>Well</i>&mdash;d'ye mean?" inquired
the mate, rather shortly;
"why no, sir&mdash;when the surgeon saw
him in the morning-watch, he said it
was a fever, and the sooner we saw
the Cape, the better for him." "No
doubt, no doubt, sir," said the second-mate,
thoughtfully, putting his fore-finger
up his twisted nose, which I
noticed he did in such cases, as if the
twist had to do with his memory,&mdash;"no
doubt, sir, that's just it! The
doctor's a sharp Edinbro' lad&mdash;did he
see aucht bye common about the captain,
sir?" "No," said Finch, "except
that he wanted to go on deck
this morning, and the surgeon took
away his clothes and left the door
locked." "Did he though?" asked
Macleod, shaking his head, and looking
a little anxious; "didna he ask
for aucht in particular, sir?" "Not
that I heard of, Mr Macleod," replied
the mate; "what do you mean?"
"Did he no ask for a green leaf?"
replied the second mate. "Pooh!"
said Finch, "what if he did?"
"Well, sir," said Macleod, "neither
you nor the doctor's sailed five
voy'ges with the captain, like me.
He's a quiet man, Captain Weelumson,
an' well he knows his calling;
but sometimes warm weather doesn't
do with him, more especial siccan
warm weather as this, when the
moon's full, as it is the night, ye
know, Mr Finch. There's something
else besides that, though, when he's
taken that way." "Well, what is
it?" asked the mate carelessly.
"Oo!" said Macleod, "it can't be
<i>that</i> this time, of course, sir,&mdash;it's
when he's near the <i>land</i>! The captain
knows the smell of it, these
times, Mr Finch, as well's a cockroach
does&mdash;an' it's then he asks for
a green leaf, and wants to go straight
ashore&mdash;I mind he did it the voy'ge
before last, sir. He's a quiet man,
the captain, as I said, for ord'nar'&mdash;but
when he's roused, he's a&mdash;"
"Why, what was the matter with
him?" said Finch, more attentive
than before, "you don't mean to say&mdash;?
go on, Mr Macleod." The second
mate, however, looked cautious, closed
his lips firmly, and twirled his red
whiskers, as he glanced with one eye
aloft again. "Hoo!" said he, carelessly,
"hoo, it's nothing, nothing,&mdash;they
just, I'm thinking, sir, what they
call disgestion ashore&mdash;all frae the
stommach, Mr Finch! We used just
for to lock the state-room door, an'
never let on we heard&mdash;but at any
rate, sir, <i>this</i> is no the thing at all, ye
know!" "Mester Semm," continued
he to the fat midshipman, who
came slowly up from the steerage,
picking his teeth with a pocket-knife,
"go forred and get the bo'sun to turn
up all hands."</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, stepping up to the
mate next moment, before the roundhouse,
"might I use the freedom of asking
whereabouts we are at present?"
Finch gave me a look of cool indifference,
without stirring head or hand;
which I saw, however, was put on,
as, ever since our boating affair, the
man evidently detested me, with all
his pretended scorn. "Oh certainly,
sir!" said he, "of course!&mdash;sorry I
haven't the ship's log here to show
you&mdash;but it's two hundred miles or so
below St Helena, eight hundred miles
odd off south-west African coast,
with a light westerly breeze bound for
the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;so after that
you can look about you, sir!" Are
you <i>sure</i> of all that, sir?" asked I,
seriously. "Oh, no, of course not!"
said he, still standing as before, "not
in the least, sir! It's nothing but
quadrant, sextant, and chronometer
work, after all&mdash;which every young
gentleman don't believe in!" Then he
muttered aloud, as if to himself,
"Well, if the captain <i>should</i> chance to
ask for a <i>green</i> leaf, I know where to
find it for him!" I was just on the
point of giving him some angry answer
or other, and perhaps spoiling all,
when I felt a tap on my shoulder,
and on turning round saw the Indian
judge, who had found me in the
way either of his passage or his prospect,
on stepping out of the starboard
door. "Eh!" said he, jocularly, as I
begged his pardon, "eh, young sir&mdash;I've
nothing to do with pardons&mdash;always
leave that to the governor-general
and councillors! Been doing anything
wrong, then? Ah, what's this&mdash;still
calm, or some of your wind again,
Mr officer?" "A fine breeze like to hold,
Sir Charles," answered the mate, all
bows and politeness. "So!" said Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Charles, "but I don't see Captain.
Williamson at all this morning&mdash;where
is he?" "I am sorry to say he is very
unwell, Sir Charles," said Finch.
"Indeed!" exclaimed the Judge, with
whom the captain stood for all the
seamanship aboard, and looking round
again rather dissatisfied. "Don't like
that, though! I hope he won't be long
unable to attend to things, sir&mdash;let me
know as soon as he is recovered, if
you please!" "Certainly, Sir Charles,"
said the chief officer, touching his cap
with some appearance of pique, "but
I hope, sir, I understand my duties in
command, Sir Charles." "Daresay,
sir," said the Judge, "<i>as</i> officer, probably.
Commander absent!&mdash;horrible
accidents already!" he muttered crossly,
changing his usual high sharp key
to a harsh croak, like a saw going
through a heavy spar, "something
sure to go wrong&mdash;wish we'd done
with this deuced tiresome voyage!"
"Ha, young gentleman!" exclaimed
he, turning as he went in, "d'ye play
chess&mdash;suppose not&mdash;eh?" "Why yes,
sir," said I, "I do." "Well," continued
he, overhauling me more carefully
than he had done before, though
latterly I had begun to be somewhat
in his good graces when we met by
chance, "after all, you've a <i>chess</i> eye,
if you know the game at all. Come
in, then, for godsake, and let's begin!
Ever since the poor brigadier <i>went</i>,
I've had only myself or a girl to play
against! 'Gad, sir, there is something,
I can't express how horrible to my
mind, in being matched against <i>nobody</i>&mdash;or,
what's worse, damme, a
<i>woman</i>! But recollect, young gentleman,
I call <i>not</i> bear a tyro!" and he
glanced at me as we walked into the
large poop-cabin, as sharply and as
cold as a nor'-wester ere it breaks to
windward. Now I happened to know
the game, and to be particularly fond
of it, so, restless as I felt otherwise, I
gave the old nabob a quiet nod, laid
down my griffin-looking straw hat on
the sofa, and in two minutes there we
were, sitting opposite over a splendid
China-made chess-board, with elephants,
emperors, mandarins, and
china-men, all square and ataunto, as
if they'd been set ready for days.
The dark Kitmagar commenced fanning
over his master's head with a
bright feather punka, the other native
servant handed him his twisted hookah
and lighted it, after which he folded
his arms and stood looking down on
the board like a pundit at some campaign
of the Great Mogul&mdash;while the
Judge himself waited for my first
move, as if it had been some of our
plain English fellows in Hindostan
commencing against your whole big
India hubbub and finery, to get hold
of it all in the end. For my part I
sat at first all of a tingle and tremble,
thinking how near his lovely daughter
might be; and there were the breakfast
cups laid out on a round table at
the other side, behind me. However I
made my move, Sir Charles made his,
and pitched in to the game in a half
impatient, half long-headed sort of
way, anxious to get to the thick of it,
as it were, once more. Not a word
was said, and you only heard the suck
of the smoke bubbling through the
water-bottle of his pipe, after each
move the Judge made; till I set myself
to the play in right earnest, and,
owing to the old gentleman's haste at
the beginning, or his over-sharpness,
I hooked him into a mess with which
I used to catch the old hands at chess
in the cock-pit, just by fancying what
<i>they</i> meant to be at. The Judge lifted
his head, looked at me, and went on
again. "Your queen is in check, Sir
Charles!" said I, next time, by way
of a polite hint. "<i>Check</i>, though,
young gentleman!" said he, chuckling,
as he dropped one of his outlandish
knights, which I wasn't yet up to the
looks of, close to windward of my
blessed old Turk of a king; so the
skirmish was just getting to be a fair
set-to, when I chanced to lift my eyes,
and saw the door from the after-cabin
open, with Miss Hyde coming through.
"Now, papa," exclaimed she on the
moment, "you must come to breakfast,"&mdash;when
all of a sudden, at seeing
another man in the cabin, she
stopped short. Being not so loud
and griffin-like in my toggery that
morning, and my hat off, the young
lady didn't recognise me at first,&mdash;though
the next minute, I saw by her
colour and her astonished look, she
not only did that, but something else&mdash;no
doubt remembering at last where
she had seen me ashore. "Well,
child," said the Judge, "make haste
with it, then!&mdash;Recollect where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
are, now, young gentleman,&mdash;and
come to breakfast." She had a pink
muslin morning-dress on, with her
brown hair done up like the Virgin
Mary in a picture, and the sea had
taken almost all the paleness off her
cheek that it had in the ball-room at
Epsom, a month or two ago,&mdash;and, by
Jove! when I saw her begin to pour
out the tea out of the silver tea-pot, I
didn't know <i>where</i> I was! "Oh, I
forgot," said the Judge, waving his
hand from me to her, in a hurry,
"Mr Robbins, Violet!&mdash;ho, Kitmagar,
curry l'ao!" "Oh," said she,
stiffly, with a cold turn of her pretty
lip, "I have met Mr&mdash;Mr&mdash;" "Collins,
ma'am," said I. "I have met
this gentleman by accident <i>before</i>."
"So you have&mdash;so you have," said
her father; "but you play chess well,
Mr&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;ah!
Colley. Gad you play <i>well</i>, sir,&mdash;we
must have it out!" The young lady
glanced at me again with a sort of astonishment;
at last she said, no doubt
for form's sake, though as indifferently
as possible,&mdash;"You have known
your friend the missionary gentleman
long, I believe, sir?&mdash;the Reverend
Mr Thomas&mdash;I think that is his name?"
"Oh no, ma'am!" said I hastily, for
the Judge was the last man I wished
should join Westwood and me together,
"only since we crossed the
Line, or so." "Why, I thought he
said you were at school together!"
said she, in surprise. "Why&mdash;hem&mdash;certainly
not, ma'am&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I
don't remember the gentleman
there," I blundered out. "Eh, what?&mdash;check
to your queen, young gentleman,
surely?" asked Sir Charles.
"What's this, though! Always like
to hear a mystery explained, so"&mdash;and
he gave me one of his sharp
glances. "Why, why&mdash;surely, young
man, now I think of it in that
way, I've seen you before in some
peculiar circumstances or other&mdash;on
land, too. Why, where was it&mdash;let
me see, now?" putting his finger to
his forehead to think, while, I sat
pretty uneasy, like a small pawn
that had been trying to get to the
head of the board, and turn into a
knight or a bishop, when it falls foul
of a grand figured-out king and queen.
However, the queen is the only piece
you need mind at distance, and blessed
hard it is to escape from <i>her</i>, of
course. Accordingly, I cared little
enough for the old nabob finding out
I had gone in chase of them; but
there sat his charming little daughter,
with, her eyes on her teacup; and
whether the turn of her face meant
coolness, or malice, or amusement, I
didn't know&mdash;though she seemed a little
anxious too, I thought, lest her father
should recollect me.</p>

<p>"It wasn't <i>before</i> me, young man?"
asked he, looking, up of a sudden:
"no, that must have been in India&mdash;<i>must</i>
have been in England, when I
was last there&mdash;let me see." And I
couldn't help fancying what a man's
feelings must be, tried for his life, as
I caught a side-view of his temples
working, dead in my wake, as it
were. The thing was laughable
enough, and for a moment I met
Lota's eye as he mentioned England&mdash;'twas
too short a glimpse, though,
to make out; and, thought I, "he'll
be down on Surrey directly, and
then Croydon&mdash;last of all, the back of
his garden wall, I suppose!" "Check"
it was, and what I was going to say
I couldn't exactly conceive, unless I
patched up some false place or other,
with matters to match, and mentioned
it to the old fellow, though small
chance of its answering with such a
devil of a lawyer&mdash;when all at once I
thought I heard a hail from aloft,
then the second-mate's voice roared
close outside, "Hullo!&mdash;aloft there!"
The next moment I started up, and
looked at Miss Hyde, as I heard
plainly enough the cry, "On deck
there&mdash;land O!" I turned round at
once, and walked out of the roundhouse
to the quarterdeck, where, two
minutes after, the whole of the passengers
were crowding from below, the
Judge and his daughter already on
the poop. Far aloft, upon the fore-to'gallant-yard,
in the hot glare of the
sun, a sailor was standing, with his
hand over his eyes, and looking to the
horizon, as the Indiaman stood quietly
before the light breeze. "Where-away-ay?"
was the next hail from
deck. "Broad on our larboard bow,
sir," was the answer.</p>

<p>We have here combined the best of
all books, and the best of all maps,
for the study of the most interesting
description of geography. Mr Johnston's
<i>Physical Atlas</i>, now published
in a form which renders it accessible
to greater numbers, is without a rival
as a companion and guide in this department
of study; and by dwelling
on its merits and utility, we should
be only echoing a verdict which has
already been pronounced by almost
every journal of scientific or critical
celebrity. And, indeed, the same
might be said of our commendation of
Mrs Somerville's book; our praise
comes lagging in the rear, and is well-nigh
superfluous. But not only are
we desirous to tender our tribute of
respect to one who has done more
than any other living writer to extend
amongst us sound, as well as general
knowledge of physical science; we are
anxious also to recommend to our
youth the enlarged method of studying
geography, which her present work
demonstrates to be as captivating as
it is instructive.</p>

<p>Mrs Somerville's <i>Physical Geography</i>
does not assume so profound an aspect,
nor has it so lofty an aim, as the
<i>Cosmos</i> of Alexander Von Humboldt;
neither can it claim, like that work,
to be written by one who has himself
surveyed the greater part of the terraqueous
globe he undertakes to describe.
This latter circumstance gives
an extraordinary interest to the <i>Cosmos</i>.
From time to time the professor
of science, gleaning his knowledge
from books, and laboratories,
and museums, steps aside, and we
hear, and almost see, the adventurous
traveller, the man Humboldt himself,
who seems to speak to us from the
distant ocean he has traversed, or the
sublime mountain heights he has
ascended. Our countrywoman can
claim no such peculiar prerogative.
Who else can? To few&mdash;to none
other&mdash;has it ever been permitted to
combine so wide a range of knowledge
with so wide a range of vision&mdash;to
have carried his mind through all
science, and his eye over all regions.
He is familiar with all the grandeurs
of our earth. He speaks with the air
of the mountain still around him.
When he discourses of the Himalaya
or the Andes, it is with the vivid
impression of one whose footsteps are
still lying uneffaced amongst their
rarely-trodden and precipitous passes.
The phenomena he describes he has
seen. He can reveal to us, and make
us feel with him, that strange impression
which "the first earthquake"
makes even upon the most educated
and reflective man, who suddenly
finds his old faith shaken in the stability
of the earth. And what lecturer
upon electricity could ever arrest the
attention of his auditors by so charming
a reference to his personal experience
as is contained in the following
passage?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was not without surprise that I
noticed, on the shores of the Orinoco,
children belonging to tribes in the lowest
stage of barbarism amusing themselves
by rubbing the dry, flat, shining seeds
of a leguminous climbing plant (probably
a negretia) for the purpose of causing
them to attract fibres of cotton or bamboo.
It was a sight well fitted to leave
on the mind of a thoughtful spectator a
deep and serious impression. How wide
is the interval which separates the simple
knowledge of the excitement of electricity
by friction, shown in the sports of these
naked, copper-coloured children of the
forest, from the invention of the metallic
conductor, which draws the swift lightning
from the storm-cloud&mdash;of the voltaic pile,
capable of effecting chemical decomposition&mdash;of
a magnetic apparatus, evolving
light&mdash;and of the magnetic telegraph!"</p></div>

<p>The writer naturally reflects on the
wide interval which separates the
knowledge of electricity shown by
these naked children on the banks of
the Orinoco, and the inventions of
modern science, which have taught
the lightnings of heaven to do our
messages on the earth. But, to our
mind, this wide interval is far more
strikingly displayed by the picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>which is here presented to the imagination,
of the profound and meditative
European looking down, pleased and
surprised, at the first unconscious
steps in experimental philosophy
which these copper-coloured children
of the forest are making in their
sport.</p>

<p>But if Mrs Somerville's book has
none of this extraordinary interest
which the great traveller has thrown
over his work, and if it does not aspire
to that philosophic <i>unity</i> of view, (of
which a word hereafter, in passing,) it
must take precedence of this, and
of all other works, as a useful compendium
of the latest discoveries, and
the soundest knowledge we possess,
in the various subjects it embraces.
Nowhere, except in her own previous
work, <i>The Connexion of the Physical
Sciences</i>, is there to be found so large
a store of well-selected information,
so lucidly set forth. In surveying
and grouping together whatever has
been seen by the eyes of others, or
detected by their laborious investigations,
she is not surpassed by any
one; and the absence of all higher
aim, or more original effort, is favourable
to this distinctness of exposition.
We have no obscurities other than
what the imperfect state of science
itself involves her in; no dissertations
which are felt to interrupt or delay.
She strings her beads distinct and
close together. With quiet perspicacity
she seizes at once whatever is
most interesting and most captivating
in her subject.</p>

<p>The <i>Cosmos</i> of Humboldt has the
ambitious aim of presenting to us
the universe, so far as we know it, in
that <i>beauty</i> of harmony which results
from <i>a whole</i>. Thus, at least, we
understand his intention. He would
domineer, as with an eagle's glance,
over the known creation, and embrace
it in its unity, displaying to us that
beauty which exists in the harmony
of all its parts. The attempt no one
would depreciate or decry, but manifestly
the imperfect state of science
forbids its execution. We have attained
no point of view from which we
can survey the world as one harmonious
whole. Our knowledge is fragmentary,
uncertain, imperfect; and
the most philosophic mind cannot
reduce it into any shape in which it
shall appear other than uncertain and
fragmentary. We cannot "stand in
the sun," as Coleridge says in his fine
verse, and survey creation; we have
no such luminous standing-point.
There never, indeed, was a time when
the attempt to harmonise our knowledge,
and view the universe of things
"in the beauty of unity," was so hopeless,
so desperate. For the old
theories, the old methods of representing
to the imagination the more
subtle and invisible agencies of the physical
world, are shaken, or exploded,
and nothing new has been able to
take their place. What is new, and
what is old, are alike unsettled, unconfirmed.
In reality, therefore, the
work of Mrs Somerville is as much a
<i>Cosmos</i> as that of Von Humboldt; and,
as a work of instruction, is far better
for not aiming higher than it does.
Mrs Somerville presents to us each
gospel of science&mdash;if we may give that
title to its imperfect revelations&mdash;and
does not bewilder or confuse by
attempting that "harmony of the
gospels" which the scientific expositor
is, as yet, unable to accomplish.</p>

<p>As yet, we have said&mdash;but, indeed,
will science be ever able to realise
this aspiration of the intellect after
unity and completeness of view? To
the reflective mind, human science
presents this singular aspect. Whilst
the speculative reason of man continually
seeks after unity, strives to
see the many in the one&mdash;as the Platonist
would express himself&mdash;or, as
we should rather say, strives to resolve
the multiplicity of phenomena into a
few ultimate causes, so as to create
for itself <i>a whole</i>, some rounded system
which the intellectual vision call embrace;
the discoveries of science, by
which it hopes and strives to realise
this end, do in fact, at every stage,
increase the apparent complexity of
the phenomena. The new agencies,
or causes, which are brought to light,
if they explain what before was anomalous
and obscure, become themselves
the source of innumerable
difficulties and conjectures. Each discovery
stirs more questions than it
sets at rest. What, on its first introduction,
promised to explain so many
things, is found, on further acquaintance,
to have added but one more to
the inexplicable facts around us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
With each step, also, in our inquiry,
the physical agents that are revealed
to us become more subtle, more calculated
to excite and to elude our
curiosity. Already, half our science
is occupied with matter that is invisible.
From time to time some
grand generalisation is proposed&mdash;electricity
is now the evoked spirit
which is to help us through our
besetting difficulties&mdash;but, fast as the
theory is formed, some new fact
emerges that will not range itself
within it; the cautious thinker steps
back, and acknowledges that the
effort is as yet premature. It always
will be premature.</p>

<p>There is a perpetual antagonism
between the intellectual tendency to
reduce all phenomena to a harmonious
and complete system, and that
increase of knowledge which, while it
seems to favour the attempt, renders
it more and more impracticable. With
our limited powers, we <i>cannot</i> embrace
the whole; and therefore it must
follow, that it is only when our knowledge
is scanty, that we seem capable
of the task. Every addition to that
knowledge, from the time that Thales
would have reduced all things to the
one element of water, has rendered
the task more hopeless. And as
science was never so far advanced as
at the present time, so this antagonism
was never so clearly illustrated between
the effort of reason to generalise,
and the influx of broken knowledge,
reducing the overtasked intellect
to despair. How much has
lately been revealed to us of the more
subtle powers and processes of nature&mdash;of
light, of heat, of electricity!
How tempting the generalisations
offered to our view! We seem to be,
at least, upon the eve of some great
discovery which will explain all: an
illusion which is destined to prompt
the researches of the ardent spirits of
every age. They will always be on
the eve of some great discovery which
is to place the clue of the labyrinth
into their hand. The new discovery,
like its predecessor, will add only
another chamber to the interminable
labyrinth.</p>

<p>Let us, for instance, suppose that
we have discovered, in electricity, the
cause of that attraction to which we
had confided the revolution of the
planets; of that chemical affinity to
which we had ascribed the various
combinations of those ultimate atoms
of which the material world is presumed
to be composed; of that vital
principle which assimilates in the
plant, and grows and feels in the
animal. Let us suppose that this is a
sound generalisation; yet, as electricity
cannot be alone both attraction
in the mass, and chemical affinity in
the atom, and irritability and susceptibility
in the fibre and the nerve,
what has the speculative reason attained
but to the knowledge of a new
and necessary agent, producing different
effects according to the different
conditions in which, and the different
co-agencies with which it operates?
These conditions, these co-agencies,
are all to be discovered. It is one
flash of light, revealing a whole world
of ignorance.</p>

<p>To the explanation of the most
obstinate of all problems&mdash;the nature
of the vital principle&mdash;we seem to
have made a great step when we
introduce a current of electricity circulating
through the nerves. If this
hypothesis be established, we shall
probably have made a valuable and
very useful addition to our stock of
knowledge; but we shall be as far as
ever from solving the problem of the
vital principle. We have now a
current of electricity circulating along
the nerves, as we had before a current
of blood, circulating through the veins
and arteries; the one may become as
prominent and as important a fact in
the science of the physician as the
other; but it will be equally powerless
with the old discovery of Harvey
to explain the ultimate cause of
vitality. To the speculative reason
it has but complicated the phenomena
of animal life.</p>

<p>Within the memory of a living
man, there has been such progress
and revolution in science, that not
one of the great generalisations taught
him in his youth can be now received
as uncontested propositions. Not
many years ago, how commodiously
a few words, such as attraction,
caloric, affinity, rays of light, and
others, could be used, and how much
they seemed to explain! Caloric was
a fluid, unseen indeed, but very obedient
to the imagination&mdash;expanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
bodies, and radiating from one to the
other in a quite orderly manner.
What is it now? Perhaps the vibration
of a subtle ether interfused
through all bodies; perhaps the vibration
of the atomic parts themselves of
those bodies. Who will venture to
say? Attraction and affinity are no
longer the clearly defined ultimate
facts they seemed to be; we know so
much, at least, that they are intimately
connected with electrical phenomena,
though not to what extent. That
electricity is implicated with chemical
composition, and recomposition, is
clearly recognised; and Sir J. Herschel
has lately expressed his opinion,
that it is impossible any longer to
attempt the explanation of the movements
of all the heavenly bodies by
simple attraction, as understood in
the Newtonian theory&mdash;these comets,
with their trains perversely turned
<i>from</i> the sun, deranging sadly our
systematic views. The ray of light,
which, with its reflection and its
refraction, seemed a quite manageable
substance, has deserted us, and we
have an ethereal fluid&mdash;the same as
that which constitutes heat, or another&mdash;substituted
in its stead. Science
has no language, and knows not how
to speak. If she lectures one day
upon the "polarisation" of light, she
professes the next not to know what
she means by the term; she is driven
even to talk of "invisible rays" of
light, or chemical rays. Never was
it so difficult to form any scientific
conception on these subjects, or to
speak of them with any consistency.
Mrs Somerville is a correct writer;
yet she opens her brief section upon
magnetism thus:&mdash;"Magnetism is one
of those unseen imponderable existences,
which, <i>like electricity and heat</i>,
are known only by their effects. It is
certainly <i>identical</i> with electricity,
for," &amp;c. It is like, and it is identical,
in almost the same sentence.</p>

<p>Even in the fields of astronomy,
where we have to deal with large
masses of matter, it is no longer possible
for the imagination to form any
embraceable system. We are plunged
into hopeless infinitude, and the little
regularities we had painfully delineated
on the heavens are all effaced. The
earth had been torn from its moorings
and sent revolving through space, but
it revolved round a central stationary
sun. Here, at least, was something
stable. The sun was a fixed centre
for our minds, as well as for the
planetary system. But the sun himself
has been uprooted, and revolves
round some other centre&mdash;we know
not what&mdash;or else travels on through
infinite space&mdash;we know not whither.
A little time ago, the stately seven
rolled round their central orb in clear
and uninterrupted space; their number
has been constantly increasing; we
reckon now seventeen planetary bodies
that can be reduced to no law of proportion
or harmony, either as to their
size, their orbits, the inclination of
their axes, or any other planetary property;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and the space they circulate
in is intruded on by other smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>and miscellaneous bodies, asteroids,
and the like, some of which, it seems,
occasionally fall to the earth. Comets
come sweeping in from illimitable
space, requiring, it is thought, some
eight thousand years for their revolution
round the sun. Some of these
cross each other's orbits: one has
crossed the orbit of the earth; and
their decreasing circle round the sun,
gives notice of some unknown ether
suffused through the interstellar spaces.
The outlying prospect, beyond our
system, grows still more bewildering.
The stars are no longer "fixed," nor
is their brilliancy secured to them;
this increases and diminishes with
perplexing mystery. What seemed
a single point of light, resolves itself
into two stars revolving round each,
perhaps reciprocally sun and planet.
The faint and telescopic nebula, just
reached by the glass in one age, is
found in the next to be a congregation
of innumerable stars. Our milky
way is, at the same distance, just such
another nebula. "The elder Herschel
calculates that the light of the
most distant nebula, discovered by
his forty-feet refractor, requires two
millions of years to reach our eyes."
Oh, shut up the telescope! the reason
reels.</p>

<p>Science, in short, presents before us
a field of perpetual activity&mdash;of endless
excitement, and that of the highest
order&mdash;of practical results of the
greatest utility and most beneficial
description; but it gives no prospect
of any resting-place&mdash;any repose for
the speculative reason&mdash;any position
with which the scientific mind shall be
content, and from which it shall embrace
the scene before it in its unity
and harmony. Always will it be</p>

</div></div>

<p>Having touched upon these subtle
agencies of light, and heat, and electricity,
and on the increasing difficulty
we have of framing to ourselves any
distinct conception of them, we cannot
refrain from alluding to a little
work or pamphlet, by Mr Grove,
entitled, <i>The Correlation of Physical
Forces</i>, in which this subject is treated
with great originality. Mr Grove
has made himself a name in experimental
science by his discoveries in
electricity and chemistry; in this
pamphlet he shows, that he has the
taste and power for enlarged speculation
on the truths which experiment
brings to light. We would recommend
the perusal of his pamphlet to
all who are interested in these higher
and more abstract speculations. How
far the wide generalisation he adopts
is sustained by facts, we are not prepared
to say. But it is a powerful
work, and it is a singular one; for it
is not often, in this country at least,
that a man so well versed in the
minuti&aelig; of science ventures upon so
bold a style of generalisation. After
reviewing some of the more lately discovered
properties of electricity, heat,
light, and magnetism, and showing
how each of them is capable of producing
or resolving itself into the
others, he reasons that all the four
are but the varied activity of one and
the same element. He adds, that
this element is probably no other than
the primitive atom itself; and that,
in fact, these may be all regarded
as affections of matter, which follow
in their legal sequence, and not as the
results of separate fluids or ethers.
We are not sure that we do justice to
his views, as we have not the work at
hand, and it is some time since we
read it; but we are persuaded that
its perusal will be of interest to a
philosophic reader, though its reasoning
should fail to satisfy him.</p>

<p>But we have not placed the title of
Mrs Somerville's book at the head of
this paper, as an occasion to involve
ourselves in these dark and abstract
discussions. We are for <i>out-of-door</i>
life; we would survey this visible
round world, whose various regions,
with their products and their inhabitants,
she has brought before us.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Physical geography," thus commences
our writer, "is a description of the earth,
the sea, and the air, with their inhabitants
animal and vegetable, of the distribution
of these organised beings, and
the causes of that distribution. Political
and arbitrary divisions are disregarded:
the sea and the land are considered only
with respect to these great features, that
have been stamped upon them by the
hand of the Almighty; and man himself
is viewed but as a fellow-inhabitant of
the globe with other created things, yet
influencing them to a certain extent by
his actions, and influenced in return."</p></div>

<p>Physical geography stands thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
contrast with political and historical
geography. Russia is here no despotism,
and America no democracy; they
are only portions of the globe inhabited
by certain races. To some persons
it will doubtless seem a strange
"geography" that takes no notice of
the city, and respects not at all the
boundaries of states. Those to whom
the name recalls only the early labours
of the school-room, when counties and
county-towns formed a great branch
of learning&mdash;where the blue and red
lines upon the map were so anxiously
traced, and where, doubtless, some
suspicion arose that the earth itself
was marked out by corresponding
lines, or something equivalent to them&mdash;will
hardly admit that to be geography
which takes no note of these
essential demarcations, or allow that
to be a map in which the very city
they live in cannot be found. To them
the Physical Atlas will still seem nothing
but a series of maps, in which
most of the names have still to be
inserted. They unconsciously regard
cities and provinces as the primary
objects and natural divisions of the
earth. They share something of the
feeling of that good man, more pious
than reflective, who noted it as all
especial providence that all the great
rivers ran by the great towns.</p>

<p>Others, however, will be glad to
escape for a time from these landmarks
which man has put upon the
earth, and to regard it in its great
natural lineaments of continent and
sea, mountain and island. To do this
with advantage, it is necessary to disembarrass
ourselves, both in the book
and the map, of much that in our
usual nomenclature ranks pre-eminently
as geography. Nor is it easy
to study this, more than the older
branch of geography, without an appropriate
atlas. To turn over the
maps of Mr Johnston's, and con the
varied information which accompanies
them, is itself a study, and no disagreeable
one. Of the extent of this
information we can give no idea by
extract or quotation; it is manifestly
in too condensed a form for quotation;
it is a perfect storehouse of
knowledge, gathered from the best
authorities.</p>

<p>The first thing which strikes an
observant person, on looking over a
map, or turning round a globe, is the
unequal division and distribution of
land and water. Over little more
than one-fourth of the surface of the
earth does dry land appear; the remaining
three-fourths are overflowed
by water. And this land is by no
means equally disposed over the
globe. Far the greater part of it lies
in the northern hemisphere. "In the
northern hemisphere it is three times
greater than the south."</p>

<p>Of the form which this land assumes,
the following peculiarities have
been noticed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The tendency of the land to assume
a <i>peninsular form</i> is very remarkable,
and it is still more so that almost all the
peninsulas tend to the south&mdash;circumstances
that depend on some unknown
cause which seems to have acted very
extensively. The continents of South
America, Africa, and Greenland, are
peninsulas on a gigantic scale, all tending
to the south; the Asiatic peninsula of
India, the Indo-Chinese peninsula, those
of Corea, Kamtchatka, of Florida, California,
and Aliaska, in North America, as
well as the European peninsulas of Norway
and Sweden, Spain and Portugal,
Italy and Greece, take the same direction.
All the latter have a rounded form
except Italy, whereas most of the others
terminate sharply, especially the continents
of South America and Africa, India,
and Greenland, which have the pointed
form of wedges; while some are long and
narrow, as California, Aliaska, and Malacca.
Many of the peninsulas have an
island, or group of islands, at their extremity&mdash;as
South America, which terminates
with the group of Terra del Fuego; India
has Ceylon; Malacca has Sumatra and
Banca; the southern extremity of New
Holland ends in Van Diemen's Land; a
chain of islands run from the end of the
peninsula of Aliaska; Greenland has a
group of islands at its extremity; and
Sicily lies close to the termination of
Italy. It has been observed, as another
peculiarity in the structure of peninsulas,
that they generally terminate boldly, in
bluffs, promontories, or mountains, which
are often the last portions of the continental
chains. South America terminates
in Cape Horn, a high promontory which
is the visible termination of the Andes;
Africa with the Cape of Good Hope; India
with Cape Comorin, the last of the
Ghauts; New Holland ends with South-East
Cape in Van Diemen's Land; and
Greenland's farthest point is the elevated
bluff of Cape Farewell."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>These are peculiarities interesting
to notice, and which may hereafter
explain, or be explained by, other
phenomena. Resemblances and analogies
of this kind, whilst they are
permitted only to direct and stimulate
inquiry, have their legitimate place in
science. It was a resemblance of this
description, between the zig-zag course
of the metalliferous veins, and the path
of the lightning, which first suggested
the theory, based, of course, on very
different reasonings, that electricity
had essentially contributed to the formation
of those veins&mdash;a theory which
Mrs Somerville has considered sufficiently
sound to introduce into her
work.</p>

<p>What lies <i>within</i> our globe is still
matter of conjecture. The radius of
the earth is 4000 miles, and by one
means or another, mining, and the
examination of the upheaved strata,
and of what volcanoes have thrown
out, we are supposed to have penetrated,
with speculative vision, to about
the depth of ten miles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The increase of temperature," writes
Mrs Somerville, "with the depth below the
surface of the earth, and the tremendous
desolation hurled over wide regions by
numerous fire-breathing mountains, show
that man is removed but a few miles from
immense lakes or seas of liquid fire. The
very shell on which he stands is unstable
under his feet, not only from those temporary
convulsions that seem to shake the
globe to its centre, but from a slow, almost
imperceptible, elevation in some places,
and an equally gentle subsidence in others,
as if the internal molten matter were subject
to secular tides, now heaving and now
ebbing; or that the subjacent rocks were
in one place expanded and in another
contracted by changes in temperature."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps these "immense lakes or
seas of liquid fire" are a little too
hastily set down here in our geography.
But of these obscure regions beneath
the earth, the student must understand
he can share only in the best conjectures
of scientific men. Geology is
compelled, at present, in many cases,
to content herself with intelligent conjecture.</p>

<p>To return again to the surface of
the earth, the first grand spectacle
that strikes us is the mountains. Before
it was understood how the mountain
was the parent of the river, the
noble elevation was apt to be regarded
in the light of a ruin, as evidence
of some disastrous catastrophe, and
Burnett, in his <i>Theory of the Earth</i>,
conceived the ideal or normal state of
our planet to be that of a smooth ball,
smooth as an egg. The notion not
only betrays the low state of scientific
knowledge in his age, but a
miserable taste in world-architecture,
which, we may remark in excuse
for poor Burnett, was, almost as much
as his scientific ignorance, to be shared
with the age in which he lived. For
it is surprising, with the exception of
a few poets, how destitute men
were, in his time, of all sympathy
with, and admiration of, the grander
and more sublime objects of nature.
"We have changed all that!" The
mountain range, pouring down its
streams into the valleys on both sides,
is not only recognised as necessary to
the fertility of the plain; but, strange
to say, we become more and more
awake to its surprising beauty and
magnificence. The description of the
mountain ranges of the several continents
of the world, forms one of the
principal attractions of the study of
physical geography, and one of the
great charms of Mrs Somerville's book.</p>

<p>The mountains of Asia take precedence
of all others in altitude and
length of range.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The mean height of the Himalaya is
stupendous. Captain Gerard and his
brother estimated that it could not be less
than from 16,000 to 20,000 feet; but, from
the average elevation of the passes over
these mountains, Baron Humboldt thinks
it must be under 15,700 feet. Colonel
Sabine estimates it to be only 11,510 feet,
though the peaks exceeding that elevation
are not to be numbered, especially
at the sources of the Sutlej. Indeed, from
that river to the Kalee, the chain exhibits
an endless succession of the loftiest
mountains on earth: forty of them surpass
the height of Chimborazo, one of the
highest of the Andes, and several reach
the height of 25,000 feet at least....
The valleys are crevices so deep and narrow,
and the mountains that hang over
them in menacing cliffs are so lofty,
that these abysses are shrouded in perpetual
gloom, except where the rays of a vertical
sun penetrate their depths. From the
steepness of the descent the rivers shoot
down with the swiftness of an arrow, filling
the caverns with foam and the air
with mist.</p>

<p>"Most of the passes over the Himalaya<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
are but little lower than the top of Mont
Blanc; many are higher, especially near
the Sutlej, where they are from 18,000 to
19,000 feet high; and that north-east of
Khoonawur is 20,000 feet above the level
of the sea, the highest that has been attempted.
All are terrific, and the fatigue
and suffering from the rarity of the air in
the last 500 feet is not to be described.
Animals are as much distressed as human
beings, and many of them die; thousands
of birds perish from the violence of the
winds; the drifting snow is often fatal to
travellers, and violent thunder-storms add
to the horror of the journey. The Niti
Pass, by which Mr Moorcroft ascended to
the sacred lake of Manasa, in Tibet, is
tremendous: he and his guide had not
only to walk bare-footed, from the risk of
slipping, but they were obliged to creep
along the most frightful chasms, holding
by twigs and tufts of grass, and sometimes
they crossed deep and awful crevices on
a branch of a tree, or on loose stones
thrown across. Yet these are the
thoroughfares for commerce in the Himalaya,
never repaired, nor susceptible of
improvement, from frequent landslips and
torrents.</p>

<p>"The loftiest peaks, being bare of snow,
give great variety of colour and beauty
to the scenery, which in these passes is
at all times magnificent. During the day,
the stupendous size of the mountains, their
interminable extent, the variety and
sharpness of their forms, and, above all,
the tender clearness of their distant outline
melting into the pale blue sky, contrasted
with the deep azure above, is described
as a scene of wild and wonderful
beauty. At midnight, when myriads of
stars sparkle in the black sky, and the
pure blue of the mountains looks deeper
still below the pale white gleam of the
earth and snow-light, the effect is of unparalleled
sublimity; and no language can
describe the splendour of the sunbeams
at daybreak streaming between the high
peaks, and throwing their gigantic
shadows on the mountains below. There,
far above the habitation of man, no living
thing exists, no sound is heard; the very
echo of the traveller's footsteps startles
him in the awful solitude and silence that
reigns in these august dwellings of everlasting
snow."</p></div>

<p>The table-lands of Asia are on a
scale corresponding with its mountains.
But the same elevation, it is
remarked, is not accompanied with
the same sterility in these parts of the
world, as in the temperate zone. Corn
has been found growing at heights
exceeding the summit of Mont Blanc.
"According to Mr Moorcroft, the
sacred lake of Manasa, in Great Tibet,
and the surrounding country, is 17,000
feet above the sea, which is 1240 feet
higher than Mont Blanc. In this elevated
region wheat and barley grow,
and many of the fruits of Southern
Europe ripen. The city of H'Lassa,
in eastern Tibet, the residence of the
Grand Lama, is surrounded by vineyards,
and is called by the Chinese
'the Realm of Pleasure!'" Nevertheless
the general aspect of the table
lands is that of a terrific sterility.
Here is a striking description of them.
We should have been tempted to say,
that in this singularly dark appearance
of the sky at mid-day, there was
something of exaggeration, if our own
limited experience had not taught us
to be very cautious in attributing exaggeration
where the scenic effects of
nature are concerned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In summer the sun is powerful at
mid-day; the air is of the purest transparency,
and the azure of the sky so deep
that it seems black as in the darkest
night. The rising moon does not enlighten
the atmosphere; no warning radiance
announces her approach, till her
limb touches the horizon, and the stars
shine with the distinctness and brilliancy
of suns. In southern Tibet the verdure
is confined to favoured spots; the
bleak mountains and high plains are
sternly gloomy&mdash;a scene of barrenness
not to be conceived. Solitude reigns in
these dreary wastes, where there is not a
tree, nor even a shrub to be seen of more
than a few inches high. The scanty,
short-lived verdure vanishes in October;
the country then looks as if fire had passed
over it; and cutting dry winds blow
with irresistible fury, howling in the bare
mountains, whirling the snow through
the air, and freezing to death the unfortunate
traveller benighted in their defiles."</p></div>

<p>The description of the territory of
the East India Company will be read
with interest. We cannot afford space
to extract it. Plains and valleys the
very richest in the globe are to be
found here, as also much rank marshy
land, and also much jungle. "It has
been estimated that a third of the
East India Company's territory is
jungle."</p>

<p>As a set-off against this jungle we
have it intimated that, if proper search
were made, gold would probably be
found in this territory, as abundantly
as in California. We sincerely hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
no such discovery will be made. If
there is a sure specific for demoralising
a people, it is to involve them in
the chase for gold, instead of that profitable
industry which produces the
veritable wealth for which gold has
become the symbol and representative.
The discovery of gold in one of our
colonies would not only demoralise, it
would impoverish. It would demoralise,
by substituting for steady industry,
with steady returns, a species
of enterprise which has all the uncertainty
and fluctuation of gambling;
and it would finally impoverish by
diverting labour from the creation of
agricultural and manufacturing wealth,
to the obtaining of the dry barren
symbol of wealth, which, apart from its
representative character, has but very
little value whatever.</p>

<p>We will not look back towards
Chimborazo and the Andes, as we
should involve ourselves in long and
tempting descriptions. In Africa, it
is remarkable that we are little acquainted
with the mountains. "No
European has yet seen the Mountains
of the Moon!" What a challenge to
enterprising travellers! We know the
level sands of Africa better than these
elevations which have assumed so
magnificent a title. What a terrific
sterility does a large portion of this
the most ill-fated of the great continents
present! "On the interminable
sands and rocks of these deserts no
animal&mdash;no insect&mdash;breaks the dread
silence; not a tree nor a shrub is to be
seen in this land without a shadow.
In the glare of noon the air quivers
with the heat reflected from the red
sand, and in the night it is chilled
under a clear sky sparkling with its
host of stars." The wind of heaven,
which elsewhere breathes so refreshingly,
is here a burning blast fatal to
life; or else it drives the sand in clouds
before it, obscuring the sun, and
stifling and burying the hapless caravan.</p>

<p>In the <i>new</i> continent of America&mdash;if
it still retains that title&mdash;the desert
is comparatively rare. But its enormous
forests have, in some regions,
proved that excessive vegetation can
assume almost as terrific an appearance
as this interminable sterility.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The forests of the Amazons not only
cover the basin of that river, from the Cordillera
of Chiquitos to the mountains of
Parima, but also its limiting mountain-chains,
the Sierra Dos Vertentes and
Parima, so that the whole forms an area
of woodland more than six times the size
of France, lying between the 18th parallel
of south latitude and the 7th of north,
consequently inter-tropical and traversed
by the equator. According to Baron Humboldt,
the soil, enriched for ages by the
spoils of the forest, consists of the richest
mould. The heat is suffocating in the
deep and dark recesses of these primeval
woods, where not a breath of air penetrates,
and where, after being drenched
by the periodical rains, the damp is so excessive
that a blue mist rises in the early
morning among the huge stems of the
trees, and envelops the entangled creepers
stretching from bough to bough. A deathlike
stillness prevails from sunrise to sunset,
then the thousands of animals that inhabit
these forests join in one loud discordant
roar, not continuous, but in bursts.
The beasts seem to be periodically and
unanimously roused by some unknown impulse,
till the forests ring in universal
uproar. Profound silence prevails at
midnight, which is broken at the dawn of
morning by another general roar of the
wild chorus. The whole forest often resounds
when the animals, startled from
their sleep, scream in terror at the noise
made by bands of its inhabitants flying
from some night-prowling foe. Their
anxiety and terror before a thunder-storm
is excessive, and all nature seems to partake
in the dread. The tops of the lofty
trees rustle ominously, though not a
breath of air agitates them; a hollow
whistling in the high regions of the atmosphere
comes as a warning from the black
floating vapour; midnight darkness envelops
the ancient forests, which soon after
groan and creak with the blast of the
hurricane. The gloom is rendered still
more hideous by the vivid lightning, and
the stunning crash of thunder."</p></div>

<p>One of the most interesting subjects,
of which mention is made in the work
before us, is the gradual elevation and
subsidence observed in some portions
of these continents themselves. Just
when the imagination had become
somewhat familiar with the sudden
but very partial upheaving of the earth
by volcanic agencies, this new discovery
came to light of the slow rising
and sinking of vast areas of the land,
and unaccompanied with any earthquakes
or volcanic eruptions. In
some parts the crust of the earth has
sunk and risen again; in others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
sort of see-saw movement on a most
gigantic scale has been detected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a line crossing Sweden from
east to west, in the parallel of 56&deg; 3&acute; N.
lat., along which the ground is perfectly
stable, and has been so for centuries. To
the north of it for 1000 miles, between
Gottenburg and North Cape, the ground
is rising; the maximum elevation, which
takes place at North Cape, being at the
rate of five feet in a century, from whence
it gradually diminishes to three inches in
a century at Stockholm. South of the
line of stability, on the contrary, the land
is sinking through part of Christianstad
and Malmo; for the village of Stassten in
Scania is now 380 feet nearer to the
Baltic than it was in the time of Linn&aelig;us,
by whom it was measured eighty-seven
years ago."</p></div>

<p>It is evident that the elevation of
the land, in relation to the level of the
sea, may be produced either by an
uprising of the continent or a depression
of the bed of the ocean, permitting
the waters to sink; as also the
apparent depression of the land may
be occasioned by an elevation in the
bed of the ocean. This renders the
problem somewhat more difficult to
solve, because the causes we are seeking
to discover may be sometimes
operating at that part of the crust of
the earth which is concealed from our
view. Mr Lyell, who, in his <i>Principles
of Geology</i>, has collected and
investigated the facts bearing upon
this subject, mentions the following
as probable causes of the phenomena:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "It is easy to conceive that the
shattered rocks may assume an arched
form during a convulsion, so that the
country above may remain permanently
upheaved. In other cases, gas may drive
before it masses of liquid lava, which
may thus be injected into newly opened
fissures. The gas having then obtained
more room, by the forcing up of the incumbent
rocks, may remain at rest; while
the lava, congealing in the rents, may
afford a solid foundation for the newly
raised district.</p>

<p>2. "Experiments have recently been
made in America, by Colonel Patten, to
ascertain the ratio according to which
some of the stones commonly used in
architecture expand with given increments
of heat.... Now, according
to the law of expansion thus ascertained,
a mass of sandstone, a mile in thickness,
which should have its temperature raised
200&deg; F., would lift a super-imposed layer
of rock to the height of ten feet above its
former level. But, suppose a part of the
earth's crust one hundred miles in thickness,
and equally expansible, to have its
temperature raised 600&deg; or 800&deg;, this
might produce an elevation of between
two and three thousand feet. The cooling
of the same mass might afterwards
cause the overlying rocks to sink down
again, and resume their original position.
By such agency, we might explain the
gradual rise of Scandinavia, or the subsidence
of Greenland, if this last phenomenon
should also be established as a fact
on further inquiry.</p>

<p>3. "It is also possible that, as the clay
in Wedgwood's pyrometer contracts, by
giving of its water, and then by incipient
vitrification; so large masses of argillaceous
strata, in the earth's interior, may
shrink, when subjected to heat and chemical
changes, and allow the incumbent
rocks to subside gradually. It may frequently
happen that fissures of great extent
may be formed in rocks, simply by
the unequal expansion of a continuous
mass heated in one part, while in another
it remains in a comparatively low temperature.
The sudden subsidence of land
may also be occasioned by subterranean
caverns giving way, when gases are condensed,
or when they escape through
newly formed crevices. The subtraction,
moreover, of matter from certain parts of
the interior, by the flowing of lava and of
mineral springs, must, in the course of
ages, cause vacuities below, so that the
undermined surface may at length fall
in."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>Two agencies of the most opposite,
character have apparently been, at all
times, acting on the crust of the earth
to change its form, or add to the surface
of dry land&mdash;the volcano and the
insect!&mdash;the one the most sudden and
violent imaginable, producing in a
short time the most astonishing effects;
the other gradual, silent, and imperceptible,
yet leaving the most stupendous
monuments of its activity.
The volcano has thrown up a mountain
in a single night; there is an instance,
too, on record, where a mountain
has quite as suddenly disappeared,
destroying itself in its own violent
combustion, and breaking up with repeated
and terrific explosions. On
the other hand, besides what has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>long known of the works of the coral
insect, the microscope has revealed to
us that huge cliffs have been constructed
of the minute fossil shells of
animalcule. These creatures, abstracting
from the water, or the air, or both,
the minute particles of vegetable or
other matter they hold in solution,
first frame of them their own siliceous
shells, and then deposit these shells
by myriads, so as ultimately to construct
enormous solid mounds out of
imperceptible and fluent particles.</p>

<p>Astonishing, indeed, is the new
world of animals invisible to the naked
eye, which science has lately detected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Professor Ehrenberg," says Mrs
Somerville, "has discovered a new world
of creatures in the infusoria, so minute
that they are invisible to the naked eye.
He found them in fog, rain, and snow, in
the ocean and stagnant water, in animal
and vegetable juices, in volcanic ashes
and pumice, in opal, in the dusty air that
sometimes falls on the ocean; and he detected
eighteen species twenty feet below
the surface of the ground in peat earth,
which was full of microscopic live animals:
they exist in ice, and are not killed by
boiling water. This lowest order of animal
life is much more abundant than any
other, and new species are found every
day. Magnified, some of them seem to
consist of a transparent vesicle, and some
have a tail; they move with great alacrity,
and show intelligence by avoiding obstacles
in their course: others have siliceous
shells. Language, and even imagination,
fails in the attempt to describe
the inconceivable myriads of these invisible
inhabitants of the ocean, the air,
and the earth."</p></div>

<p>With every great change, however
brought about, in the surface of the
earth, and the climate of its several
regions, it appears that, either by the
direct agency of the Omnipotent
Creator, or through the intermediate
operations of laws which are at present
profound secrets to us, a corresponding
change takes place in the forms of
animal life, and in the whole vegetable
kingdom. Modern science presents
no subject to us of more interest than
this, and none apparently so inscrutable.
Nor does the examination of
the globe, as it exists before us at this
moment, with its various floras and
faunas, at all assist us in forming any
conception of the law by which the
geological series (if we may so term
it) of animal life, has been regulated,
for the distribution of the several
animals over the several countries and
climates of the world follows no rule
that one can detect. Of course, no
animal can exist where provision has
not been made for its subsistence, but
the provision has been made with the
same abundance in two countries, and
in the one the animal is found, and
the other not. We should ask in
vain why the horse was found a native
of the deserts of Tartary, and
why it was originally unknown to the
plains of America? Nor can any
cause be detected for the difference
between the congeners, a representative
species of one continent or island,
and those of another. And not only
have the larger animals an arbitrary
territory marked out to them by nature,
but birds, and even insects, are
separated and grouped together in the
same unaccountable manner. The
chapters which Mrs Somerville has
devoted to this subject will be read,
especially by those to whom the topic
is new, with extreme interest. They
are enlightened and judicious.</p>

<p>It is a natural supposition to make,
that, in the series of animals which at
great geological periods have been
introduced upon the earth, there has
been a <i>progression</i>, so that each new
form of animal life has been, in some
marked manner, superior to that which
is substituted. The comparative anatomist
has not sanctioned this opinion;
he tells us that he finds the same "high
organisation" in the fossil saurians of
a bygone world, as in the lions and
leopards of the present day. But
we would observe that the presence
of this "high organisation" is not
sufficient to determine the question.
We should be surprised, indeed, if
any creature were to be found whose
structure was not perfectly adapted
to the mode of life it was destined to
lead. But it is permissible to compare
one animal with another in its
whole nature, and the character of its
existence. The pig has the same
high organisation as the dog, yet we
should certainly prefer the one animal
to the other; we should say that it
was calculated for a happier life. We
cannot suppose that a bird is not a
more joyous creature than the worm or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
the snail. The adaptation of the whole
form and structure to a pleasurable
existence, and not what is termed high
organisation, is that which we must
regard, in estimating the superiority of
one animal to another. Now, in this
respect, there surely has been a progression
from the earliest epochs.
The crocodile and the tortoise are,
amongst the animals which now exist,
those which most resemble some of
the more remarkable of the extinct
genera. They are as perfectly
adapted, no doubt, as any other creature,
to their peculiar mode of
being; but that mode of being is not
an enviable one. The long stiff unwieldy
body of the one, and the slow
movement, with the oppressive carcase,
of the other, are not consistent
with vivid animal enjoyment. The
crocodile, accordingly, lies motionless
for hours together&mdash;<i>waits</i> for its prey&mdash;and
slumbers gorged with food.
And for the tortoise, it appears to
lead a life as near to perpetual torpor
as may be. Pass through a museum,
and note those huger animals, the
elephant and the rhinoceros, the seal
or walrus, all those which most
remind us of the gigantic creatures of
the antediluvian world, and compare
them with the horse, the deer, the
dog, the antelope. Surely the latter
present to us a type of animal life
superior to the former&mdash;superior, inasmuch
as the latter are altogether calculated
for a more vivacious, sprightly,
and happy existence. We must not
venture to remark on their greater
comparative <i>beauty</i>, for we shall be
told that this is a matter for our own
peculiar taste. We should not be
contented to be so easily silenced on
this head, but we should require far
more space than we have now at our
disposal to defend our &aelig;sthetic notions.</p>

<p>We have found ourselves imperceptibly
conducted from the inanimate
to the animate creation; we
shall proceed, therefore, with the same
topic, in the few farther extracts we
shall be able to make from the work
before us. Indeed, with so vast a
subject, and so brief a space, it would
be idle to affect any great precision
in the arrangement of our topics;
enough if they follow without abruptness,
and are linked together by
natural associations of thought.</p>

<p>"Three hundred thousand insects
are known!" and every day, we were
almost going to add, increases the
number. They abound, as may be
expected, in equatorial regions, and
decrease towards the poles. "The
location of insects depends upon that
of the plants which yield their food;
and as almost each plant is peopled
with inhabitants peculiar to itself,
insects are distributed over the earth
in the same manner as vegetables;
the groups, consequently, are often
confined within narrow limits, and it is
extraordinary that, notwithstanding
their powers of locomotion, they often
remain within a particular compass,
though the plant, and all other circumstances
in their immediate vicinity,
appear equally favourable for their
habitation."</p>

<p>Mountain-chains, Mrs Somerville
observes, are a complete barrier to
insects; they differ even in the two
sides of the Col de Tende in the Alps,
and they are limited in the choice of
their food. If a plant is taken to a
country where it has no congeners, it
will be safe from the insects of that
country; but if it has congeners, the
insect inhabitants will soon find the
way to it. Our cabbages and carrots,
when transplanted to Cayenne, were
not injured by the insects of that
country; and the tulip tree, and other
magnolias brought here, are not molested
by our insects.</p>

<p>The insect is a race, or order, of
creatures not friendly to man, or any
of the larger animals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The mosquito and culex are spread
over the world more generally than any
other tribe; they are the torment of men
and animals from the poles to the equator,
by night and by day; the species are
numerous, and their location partial.... Of
all places on earth, the Orinoco,
and other great rivers of tropical America,
are the most obnoxious to this plague.
The account given by Baron Humboldt is
really fearful; at no season of the year,
at no hour of the day or night, can rest
be found; whole districts in the Upper
Orinoco are deserted on account of these
insects. Different species follow one
another with such precision, that the
time of day or night may be known accurately
from their humming noise, and
from the different sensations of pain which
the different poisons produce. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
respite is the interval of a few minutes
between the departure of one gang and
the arrival of their successors, for the
species do not mix. On some parts of
the Orinoco, the air is one dense cloud of
poisonous insects to the height of twenty
feet."</p></div>

<p>The sea, as well as the air, is populous
with insect life. The discoloured
portions of the ocean generally owe
their tint to myriads of insects. The
vermilion sea off California is probably
to be accounted for from this
cause, "as Mr Darwin found red
and chocolate-coloured water on the
coast of Chili, over spaces of several
square miles, full of microscopic animalcules,
darting about in every direction,
and sometimes exploding"&mdash;we
hope for joy. "In the Arctic seas,
where the water is pure transparent
ultramarine colour, parts of twenty or
thirty square miles, one thousand five
hundred feet deep, are green and
turbid, from the quantity of minute
animalcules. Captain Scoresby calculated
that it would require eighty
thousand persons working unceasingly,
from the creation of man to the present
day, to count the number of insects
contained in two miles of the
green water."</p>

<p>Captain Scoresby must be very fond
of calculations. We have noticed, by
the way, on several occasions, how
very bold these men of figures are!
One pounds and pulverises the Pyrenees,
and strews them over France,
and tells us how many feet this would
raise the level of the whole country.
Another calculates how much soil the
Mississippi brings down, per hour, to
the ocean; and another, still bolder,
undertakes to say what quantity of
ice lies amongst the whole range of
the Alps. Some of these calculations
are laborious inutilities, as it is evident
that no accurate data can be
obtained to proceed upon. In the
last instance, how find the depth of
the ice? The sand of the desert has
been sounded in one place, we are told,
and the lead has sunk three hundred
and sixty feet without finding a bottom;
but what plummet can sound the glacier?
Here and there a crevice may
let us into the secret of its depth, and
we know that below a certain level ice
cannot remain unmelted; but who can
tell the configuration of the mountain
under the ice, how shallow the glacier
may be in some parts, and into what
profound caverns it may sink in others?
There is something childish in giving
us an array of figures, when the figures
present no useful approximation to
the truth.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the difficult
problem of the distribution of the
different species of animals throughout
the several regions of the globe:
the same problem meets us in the
vegetable world. Here we might
expect to grapple with it with some
better hopes of success, yet the difficulties
are by no means diminished;
we only seem to see them more plainly.
In the first place, it is clear, as Mrs
Somerville says, that "no similarity
of existing circumstances can account
for whole families of plants being confined
to one particular country, or
even to a very limited district, which,
as far as we can judge, might have
grown equally well in many others."
But the <i>difference</i> of the floras is not
the only difficulty. While there is
difference in a great number of the
species, there is <i>identity</i> in a certain
other number. If now we account
for the difference by supposing that
the several portions of land emerged
from the ocean at different epochs,
and under different conditions, and
that, therefore, the generative powers
of vegetable life, (in whatever, under
the will of Divine Providence, these
may be supposed to consist) manifested
themselves differently, how
shall we next account for this identity?
"In islands far from continents, the
number of plants is small; but of
these a large proportion occur nowhere
else. In St Helena, of thirty flower-bearing
plants one or two only are
native elsewhere." But these one
or two become a new perplexity.
"In the Falkland Islands there are
more than thirty flowering plants
identical with those in Great Britain."
Very many similar cases might be
cited; we quote these only to show
the nature of the difficulty with which
science has to cope.</p>

<p>And here comes in the following
strange and startling fact, to render
this subject of vegetable production
still more inexplicable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Nothing grows under these great
forests, (of South America;) and when accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
burnt down in the mountainous
parts of Patagonia, they never rise again;
<i>but the ground they grow on is soon covered
with an impenetrable brushwood of other
plants</i>. In Chili the violently stinging
Loasa appears first in these burnt places,
bushes grow afterwards, and then comes
a tree-grass, eighteen feet high, of which
the Indians make their huts. The new
vegetation that follows the burning of
primeval forests is quite unaccountable.
The ancient and undisturbed forests of
Pennsylvania have no undergrowth; and
when burnt down they are succeeded by
a thick growth of rhododendrons."&mdash;(Vol.
ii. p. 190.)</p></div>

<p>But we must bring our rambling
excursion through these pleasant
volumes to a close; the more especially
as we wish once more to take this
opportunity, not as critics only, but
as readers also, to express our grateful
sense of the benefit which Mrs
Somerville has conferred upon society
by this and her preceding volume,
<i>The Connexion of the Physical Sciences</i>.
It was once a prevailing habit to
speak in a sort of apologetic strain of
works of popular science. Such habit,
or whatever residue of it remains, may
be entirely laid aside. If by popular
science is meant the conveyance, in
clear intelligible language, as little
technical as possible, of the results of
scientific inquiry, then are we all of us
beholden more or less to popular
science. The most scientific of men
cannot be equally profound in all
branches of inquiry. The field has
now become so extensive that he cannot
hope to obtain his knowledge in
all departments from the first sources.
He must trust for much to the authority
of others. Every one who is
desirous of learning what anatomy
and physiology can teach us, cannot
attend the dissecting table. How
much that we esteem, as amongst the
most valuable of our acquisitions,
depends on this secondary evidence!
How few can follow the calculations
of the mathematician, by which he
establishes results which are nevertheless
familiar to all as household words!
And the mathematician himself, great
aristocrat as he is in science, must
take the chemist on his word for the
nice analysis the latter has performed.
He cannot leave his papers to follow
out experiments, often as difficult and
intricate as his own calculations. Indeed
the experiments of the man of
science have become so refined and
elaborate, and deal often with such
subtle matter, and this in so minute
quantities, that, as it has been said
of the astronomer, that it requires a
separate education, and takes half a
life to learn to observe, so it may
be truly said, that to devise and conduct
new experiments in philosophy
has become an art in itself. We must
be content to see a great deal with
the eyes of others; to be satisfied with
the report of this or that labourer in
the wide field of science. We cannot
all of us go wandering over moor and
mountain to gather and classify herbs
and flowers; interested as we all are
in geological speculations, we cannot
all use the geological hammer, or use
it to any purpose; still less can we
examine all manner of fishes, or pry
with the microscope into every cranny
of nature for <i>infusoria</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs Somerville gives us the book!&mdash;the
neat, compact, valuable volume,
which we hold so commodiously in
the hand. The book&mdash;the book for
ever! There are who much applaud
the lecture and the lecture-room, with
its table full of glittering apparatus,
glass and brass, and all the ingenious
instruments by which nature, as we
say, is put to the torture. Let such
as please spend their hot uneasy hour
in a crowd. We could never feed in
a crowd; we detest benches and sitting
in a row. To our notion, more is
got, in half the time, from a few pages
of the quiet letterpress, quietly perused:
the better if accompanied by skilful
diagrams, or, as in this case, by admirable
maps. As to those experiments,
on the witnessing of which so
much stress is laid, it is a great fallacy
to suppose that they add anything to
the certainty of our knowledge. When
we see an experiment performed at a
distance, in a theatre, we do, in fact,
as entirely rely on the word of the
lecturer as if we only read of its performance.
It is our faith in his character
that makes all the difference
between his exhibition and that of
the dexterous conjurer. To obtain
any additional evidence from beholding
the experiment, we ought to
be at the elbow of the skilful manipulator,
and weigh, and test, and
scrutinise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>But, indeed, as a matter of evidence,
the experiment in a popular lecture-room
is never viewed for a moment.
It is a mere show. It has degenerated
into a mere expedient to attract
idlers and keep them awake. The
crowd is there, and expect to see something;
and it has become the confirmed
habit of the whole class of popular
lecturers to introduce their experiments,
not when they are wanted to
elucidate or prove their propositions,
but whenever and wherever they can
answer the purpose of amusing the
audience. If a learned professor is
lecturing upon the theory of combustion,
he will burn a piece of stick or
paper before you, to show that when
such things are burnt flame is produced.
He would on no account forego
that flame. Yes; and the audience
look on as if they had never seen a
stick or a piece of paper burn before.
And when he is so happy as to arrive
at the point where a few grains of gunpowder
may be ignited, they give him
a round of applause! In the hands of
many, the lecture itself becomes little
more than an occasion for the experiment.
The glittering vials, the air-pump,
the electrical machine, undoubtedly
keep the eyes at least of the
audience open; but the expedient,
with all due deference be it said, reminds
us of the ingenious resource of
the veteran exhibitor of <i>Punch</i>, who
knows that if his puppets receive
knocks enough, and there is sufficient
clatter with the sticks, the dramatic
dialogue may take its course as it
pleases: he is sure of his popularity.</p>

<p>Therefore it is we are for the book; and
we hold such presents as Mrs
Somerville has bestowed upon the
public to be of incalculable value, disseminating
more sound information
than all the literary and scientific institutions
will accomplish in a whole
cycle of their existence. We will conclude
with one or two practical suggestions,
which would add to the utility
of the last of her two works&mdash;<i>The Physical
Geography</i>. Mrs Somerville has
thought it well to insert a few notes
explanatory of some scientific terms.
But these notes are few. If it
was well to explain such terms as
"Marsupial animals," or "Testacea,"
a reader might be excused for
wishing to know what a "torsion
balance" was, or what a "moraine,"&mdash;terms
which fall upon him just as
suddenly, and unexplained by any
previous matter. Would not a glossary
of such terms be advisable? But
whatever may be thought of this suggestion,
our next remark is indisputable.
To such a work as this, an
index is extremely useful&mdash;is all but
essential. There is an index, but it is
so defective, so scanty, that it is worth
nothing. We cannot say whether
this last remark applies equally to
<i>The Connexion of the Physical Sciences</i>,
not having that work at present under
our eye. But we beg to intimate to
all authors and authoresses, that
whenever a book is of such a nature
that it becomes valuable as a work of
reference, it should be accompanied by
a good index. It is a plodding business,
but it must be executed.</p>

<h2><a name="CIVIL_REVOLUTION_IN_THE_CANADAS_A_REMEDY" id="CIVIL_REVOLUTION_IN_THE_CANADAS_A_REMEDY">CIVIL REVOLUTION IN THE CANADAS&mdash;A REMEDY.</a></h2>


<p>To be British, or not to be, is now
literally the question in all the North
American colonies. Like England,
when Mr Cobden and the potato
blight produced, together, a panic
which seemed to obliterate, for the
time, all past arguments, and all
future consequences&mdash;changing minds
before deemed unchangeable, and
raising to fame and greatness men
and reasoning that the world was
never previously able to see the force
or the depth of&mdash;like England then,
are the colonies now. They are in all
the depths and mazes of a panic. One
of the storms which occasionally break
over the heads of all people is now
raging over theirs. Nor is it surprising&mdash;with
England's history for
ten years before us&mdash;if there should be
those among them who shrink from
its drenchings or its shocks, or are
incapable, in the midst of its wild
commotions, of seeing sunshine in the
distance. For our part, we are fond
of that sturdy greatness which can put
its shoulder to the blast, and say,
"Blow on, great guns; we can stand
your thunder."</p>

<p>Not that the panic in the colonies
arises from the people's looking forward
to having nothing to eat. They
have plenty, thank God, and to spare.
But they have nothing in their pockets;
and, what is worse, they are afraid, if
they go on much longer as they are
now doing, they will soon be without
pockets too. Factory cotton may be
but fourpence a yard; but if they
haven't the fourpence to pay for it, it
might as well be as dear as diamonds,
as far as they are concerned.</p>

<p>The policy of England, from the day
that Lord Chatham said "that he
would not allow the colonies to make
a hob-nail for themselves," has been
to convert them into marts for her
manufactures&mdash;to make them useful
and profitable to her, by causing them
to consume those things which give
her poor employment, her merchants
and manufacturers profit, and her
commercial navy all the incidental
carrying trade. As a return for this,
the colonies were directly and indirectly
assured by England, that their
produce should be protected in her
markets&mdash;that, for all the profits England
might make by manufacturing
for the colonies, they should have a
full return in the profits they should
have by their produce being protected.</p>

<p>Meantime, the United States pursued
an entirely different system. They,
notwithstanding the interests of the
great body of the southern states&mdash;whose
interest, their principal product
being cotton, was to buy what they
wanted of manufactured goods in the
lowest market, and to sell their cotton
in the highest&mdash;rigidly adhered to the
system of forming manufacturing interests
of their own, and of fostering and
encouraging them by every means in
their power. While the colonies,
therefore, bought, with the produce
of their country, broad cloths, cottons,
silks, blankets, scythes, hardware, and
crockery, which were manufactured
in England, they saw all the profits
of their manufacture, their sale, and
their carriage, go to another country,
to be spent among another people.
The Americans, on the other hand,
who bought, with the produce of their
lands, the manufactures of their own
country, saw the profits upon these
manufactures applied to building up
factories, villages, and towns, which
brought together a useful population;
built churches, made roads, established
places of learning and improvement;
made better markets for some things
which might have been sold otherwise,
and made sale for many that
could not otherwise have been sold at
all, besides greatly enhancing the
values of all adjacent property, and
increasing the general wealth of the
whole country. The advantages
of the one system over the other,
however, did not stop here. The
necessities and the advantages of
manufactures, which first dictated the
making and improving of a common
road, next conceived the benefit of a
railroad and a canal, and the profits
of manufacturing were straightway
applied to their construction, and they
were done. The farmer, therefore,
imperceptibly to himself, was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
within a few hours of the best markets
over the continent&mdash;found his
produce carried to them for a trifle, in
comparison to what it used to cost
him&mdash;and found, withal, the process
which made it so, bringing thousands
upon thousands of people into the
country, to develop its riches, to increase
the price of its lands, and to
contribute to its civilisation and
conveniencies, from the establishment
of a college down to the building of a
blacksmith's shop. The colonial
farmer, too, who bought the goods of
an English or a Scotch manufacturer,
contributed to send those manufacturers'
children to school, to give
them a profession, or to leave them a
fortune. The American farmer, who
bought his neighbours' manufactures,
contributed to establish a school in
his own neighbourhood, where his
children could be educated; and to
bring people together to support them,
if they chose to study a profession or
to enter into business.</p>

<p>To trace, within the limits of a
whole magazine even, much less in
the fragment of an article, the wealth
and prosperity that have accrued to
the States over the Colonies, by this
system, would be impossible. We
must content ourselves, for the present,
with glancing at the accumulation
of capital, and the extraordinary
improvements in one State, as an
example of what must have, and in
truth what has, accrued to the rest,
in a greater or less degree, in proportion
as they have been engaged in
manufacturing.</p>

<p>The state of Massachusetts, in
point of soil, climate, and resources,
has fewer, or, at all events, as few advantages
as any other state in the
American Union. With a few verdant
valleys, and some highly productive
land, it has much that is
rocky and barren, and more that is
marshy and useless. Yet this state,
far below Upper Canada in natural
advantages, has, intersecting it in
different ways, five canals, their aggregate
length being ninety-nine
miles. It has, too, no fewer than
eleven railroads winding through it
and round it, constructed at an immense
cost, and affording a profitable
return to their proprietors. Now
what is the cause of this extraordinary
growth of capital, in a place where
there was literally so little for it to
grow upon?&mdash;and how came such
immense facilities for public business
to be employed, where nature has done
so little to create business? The
answer is obvious. Massachusetts has
not prospered by its land, or natural resources&mdash;it
has prospered by its manufactures;
and its improvements, great
and extraordinary though they be, are
but the natural offspring of those
manufactures. Its principal manufacturing
town, Lowell, the largest such
town in the United States, has
grown from a few hundred inhabitants,
that the land might have feebly
supported, to some forty thousand,
that manufactures have profitably
employed. The necessities of these
manufactures called for a canal
and a railroad. The profits of the
capital invested in them, and the
labour they employed, soon constructed
them. Salem, wholly by the
profits of making cotton fabrics, has
become a town of fifteen thousand
inhabitants. Salem's manufacturing
interests required a railroad to Boston,
and Salem's manufacturers' and
artisans' profits were able to construct
it. Manchester and Lawrence owe
their existence and prosperity, and
the adjacent country owes the advantages
they are to it, wholly to manufactories.
They wanted, too, a railroad
to connect them; and they were
able to make, and have made one.
Springfield, also in this State, and
Worcester, Fallriver, Lynn, and Newburyport,
and several other places of
minor consequence, owe equally their
existence and prosperity to the same
cause. Nor is it to be wondered at
that, in so short a period, such vast
improvements should be made, when
we consider the immense profits that
have accrued upon the capital employed
in these manufactories, and
upon the labour engaged in them.
There is a cotton factory in Salem
which itself employs a capital of
&pound;200,000, giving work to five hundred
and seventy-five operatives,&mdash;three-fourths
of whom are girls,&mdash;whose
average wages are three pounds twelve
shillings sterling a month. Yet, a
great proportion of these being very
young, it necessarily follows that the
wages of the grown up are reduced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
make up the average of those of the
weaker, and that in reality an industrious
woman "can generally earn a
dollar a day; and there are those who
have been known, from one year's end
to another, even to exceed this."
Speaking of the character of this labour,
and of its effect upon the States,
Mr Webster, the highest authority
upon this subject in America, thus
truthfully and eloquently remarks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have spoken of labour as one of the
great elements of our society, the great
substantial interest on which we all stand.
Not feudal service, not predial toil, not
the irksome drudgery by one race of mankind,
subjected, on account of colour, to
the control of another race of mankind;
but labour, intelligent, manly, independent,
thinking and acting for itself, earning
its own wages, accumulating those wages
into capital, becoming a part of society
and of our social system, educating childhood,
maintaining worship, claiming the
right of the elective franchise, and helping
to uphold the great fabric of the State.
<span class="smcap">That is American labour</span>, and I confess
that all my sympathies are with it, and
my voice, until I am dumb, will be for
it."</p></div>

<p>Of the profits arising from the capital
invested in these manufactures,
they have varied in different years,
but have, on the average, vastly exceeded
those upon all similar investments
in England, or in any part of
Europe. The <i>Newburyport Herald</i>,
a couple of years since, gave a statement
of the profits arising from the
Essex Steam Mill Company in that
town, by which it appeared <i>that forty-two
and a half per cent</i> upon the capital
invested was paid to the stockholders,
as the amount of profits for
1845. The Dedham Company, in the
same state, also divided ten per cent
for six months of the same year; the
Norfolk Company, twelve per cent for
the same period; and the Northern
Company ten. All these companies
were engaged in the manufacture of
cotton goods&mdash;the most profitable,
however, of all manufactures in the
States.</p>

<p>But against this immense accumulation
of capital in the States, against
the vast incidental improvements and
wealth to the country that have arisen
from manufactures, what have the
British colonies to show? What have
the Canadas to arrest the eye of the
traveller, and to prove to him that,
though they have pursued the system
which Lord Chatham chalked out for
them, of not manufacturing a hob-nail
for themselves&mdash;and which the policy
of England has ever since prevented
their doing&mdash;they have still wherewithal
to attest that they have prospered;
and that their labour has been
equally rewarded by agriculture as
by manufactures?</p>

<p>From one end of the provinces to
the other, in every colony Britain has
in America, there are no evidences of
prosperity approaching, much less
equalling that of Massachusetts; there
is nothing, in truth, wherewith to institute
a comparison between them.
Beyond the towns which are supported
by the trade incident to selling England's
goods, there are none to be
found in British America. Beyond
the little villages throughout the provinces,
that owe their existence to the
necessity for agencies to collect the
profits of the whole products of the
country, and to send them to other
lands to be spent, there is no appearance
of labour employed in business,
or capital reproducing capital. Probably
one of the best cultivated and
most productive districts in Upper
Canada, is the Gore. It is situated at
the head of Lake Ontario; has the
beautiful little city of Hamilton for its
capital; is composed of very fair land,
and is settled by a population distinguished
for their industry, and for the
great comfort and independence it has
brought them. Upon entering this
district by the high road from Toronto,
or in passing in a steamer up the
north shore of Lake Ontario, the traveller
is struck with the appearance
of a little village called Oakville. It
is situated on the bank of the lake,
has its neat white churches, and its
little picturesque cottages, looking out
upon the broad lake. A stranger at
a distance, from its situation and
appearance, would imagine it one of
those villages that spring up so magically
in America,&mdash;full of activity,
energy, and prosperity. He visits it,
and to his surprise he finds, that
though it bears all the evidences of
having been built in a hurry, it bears
also all the tokens of rapid decay&mdash;its
shops being for the most part unoccupied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
its houses untenanted, and its
streets without people. And what
may be the reason, in a district so
prosperous as the Gore, and surrounded
by a country teeming with
grain, and with still many unused
resources, that this village has so
palpably disappointed the expectations
if its founder? It is this,&mdash;Oakville
was projected and built with
a view to the largest prosperity of the
country; and with facilities and necessities
for a trade equal to the cultivation
of every lot of land in the adjacent
country that could support a family,
and to the manufacturing into staves
and boards, and square timber, of
every tree in the surrounding woods.
But the policy of England has rendered
it unprofitable to get out the
timber; and free trade has taken
away the inducement to enter into
Canadian farming. The consequence
is that the shops, which were built to
do an anticipated trade in Oakville,
are now unrequired; and the people,
who built houses for the accommodation
of those who were to be engaged
in the expected business, have their
houses upon their hands. Nor can
any one well acquainted with Upper
Canada fail to recognise in Oakville
a faithful picture of many, if not most,
of the towns and villages in the province.</p>

<p>But let us now reverse the picture,
and suppose that Oakville, instead of
looking forward to rising, and being
supported by the trade incident to
selling England's goods, and the
draining of the country's resources to
pay for them, had looked forward to
prosperity by manufacturing and selling
goods of its own. Let us suppose
that its founder&mdash;who, fifteen years
ago, spent some &pound;20,000 in adapting
its harbour for ships, that never had
occasion to come; and in building
storehouses, for which there has
never been use&mdash;had spent the same
money in establishing one of these
factories which first formed the nucleus
of Lowell or Salem in Massachusetts.
Is it not reasonable to infer, that in
the same country, and among a people
having the same necessities, the same
results would have accrued in the
Canadas which have accrued in the
States? That the profits of fifteen
years' manufacturing would have
surrounded Oakville with mansions,
proving the success of enterprise;
and filled its streets with houses,
showing that labour had prospered,
and the country had its benefits?
Would not its capitalists, instead of
empty houses and ruined hopes, have
now the proceeds of well-invested
capital, or see them reproducing
wealth in railroads, or public improvements?</p>

<p>But let us suppose, further, that the
whole province of Upper Canada had
invested in manufactures, from time
to time, for fifty years, the whole profits
that England and other countries
have made by the sale of all the goods
to it that it has consumed, and that
this capital had been augmenting and
reproducing itself during this period&mdash;what
would be the probable result?
It is impossible to calculate it. It
can only be measured by the towns
that have sprung up, by the railroads
and canals that have been made, and
by the vast capital that has been
accumulated in the same period by
Massachusetts, and the other manufacturing
states of America.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, to institutions
or to laws, to peculiarities of race or
of situation, that we ascribe the present
undeniable prosperity of the
States, or, at all events, of those states
which have manufactured, over the
Canadas. It is to the system the one
adopted, of manufacturing what they
required, and thus securing to their
country the benefit of the population
it required to do so, the profits of the
labour employed in it, and the incidental
improvements it occasioned. It is
the system the other followed, or which
was chalked out for them, of spending
all they could make in the purchase
of goods manufactured in England,
the profits of which all went there to
be spent. The States, by the one
system, have made the most of their
country's resources and its labour;
the Canadas, by the other, have made
the least. The States have cities,
and railroads, and canals, and elegant
mansions, to show for their labour of
fifty years; the Canadas have built
elegant mansions, too, by their labour,
and have bought fine countryseats,
and have contributed to make
railroads, but they are unfortunately
all in England and Scotland. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
holds good of a family, sometimes
holds good of a people. There is as
much often accumulated by saving as
by making. Probably the making
little, and saving it, will end better
than making much and saving little.
The States might have made but little
on their produce at first&mdash;probably
less, for many years, than the Canadas;
but their system inevitably
tended to saving for the country all
they did make; whereas the Canadian
system, whatever the provinces
made, much or little, as inevitably
tended to the country's losing it:
and the consequences are, the vast
difference in the growth of capital in
the one country over the other.</p>

<p>The arguments, however, in favour
of England's manufacturing for the
colonies, were not without their speciousness,
and, as applied to other
countries, were not without their
truth. These were, that England
could manufacture cheaper for the
colonies than they could manufacture
for themselves; and, moreover, that
the labour the colonies might apply
to manufacturing, could be more profitably
employed in raising produce.
But these arguments, as far as the
Canadas and all America are concerned,
are fallacious. In a country
where the largest possible reward for
labour bears frequently no sort of proportion
to the advantages gained by
individuals and the whole commonwealth,
by the mere fact of that
labour's being employed in it, the
question changes from what the people
save upon a yard of calico, to what
the country loses by towns not being
built, by railroads not being made,
and by improvements not taking
place that always follow manufactures.
It may be true, that where
the greatest possible reward for labour
is the only object sought for or attainable,
that a people should find out,
and engage in what pays them best:
but where the congregation of a hundred
people in one place raises the
value of property there ten thousand
fold&mdash;and such has often been
the case in the States&mdash;and every
farmer adjacent not only gains a
market by them, but has his roads
improved, his lands increased in value,
double, and triple, and ten times;
and has a thousand conveniences and
benefits supplied him by them, that
he never otherwise could have had&mdash;then
the question arises with him,
Which benefited him most?&mdash;the hundred
people's manufacturing, and
spreading the profits of their labour
around them, or the buying a few
yards of cloth a few shillings cheaper,
and keeping the hundred people
away? For every penny that the
whole people of the United States
have lost, by buying their own goods,
they have made pounds by making
them. And the profits of a mechanic's
own labour sink into utter insignificance,
in comparison to the wealth
he often acquires by a single lot of
land, upon which he settles down
with others, and which makes him
rich by also enriching all around him.
To measure, indeed, the advantages
that manufactures have given to
America, by the mere profits of the
actual labour employed in them, would
be but like valuing an oak at the price
of one of its acorns. Men may compute
the probable profits of labour
employed in manufacturing, by computing
the cost of raw material with
the expense of manufacturing it, and
what it sold for. But the enormous
wealth that has accrued to America,&mdash;by
the increase of population incident
to manufacturing, by the development
of its resources, and the gigantic
improvements that have followed it&mdash;would
be utterly out of the reach of
all human industry to compute.</p>

<p>But in striking out the system England
did for her colonies, she should,
at least have considered whether the
benefits she intended to confer would
be really used as benefits; whether
the system of protection to colonial
produce was not, in fact, something like
that of indulgent parents giving to
their sons pocket-money in addition
to sufficient salaries&mdash;which same
pocket-money does not generally add
to the morals or property of the
recipients. And, in truth, this was
in effect the character of England's
colonial protective system. But it
went a little farther than the wisdom
displayed by anxious parents; for,
with the gifts, it took good care to
furnish temptations to spend them&mdash;a
piece of amiable generosity that we
would acquit even all indulgent
mothers of. However, this was&mdash;whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
England meant, or expected,
to the contrary&mdash;practically the effect
of the system. When money was
sent out to buy produce or timber, it
was always sure to be accompanied
by a proportionate stock of broad
cloths and silks, challis and shawls.
Those who could have done very
well with Canadian gray, were induced
to buy broad cloths, and
often found but these in the market;
for England bought the country's
crop, and England's merchants knew
full well what the farmers could afford
to pay for. Women wore silk
dresses and satin bonnets, who might
have looked charming enough, before
their friends at meeting, in Hoyle's
prints, or before all reasonable beaus
at home, in good, honest, home-made
flannel. Brandy and water, too, was
too often substituted for wholesome
cider, and fashionable tailors for
industrious women. The sliding-scale
of expenditure always went up and
down to suit the times. A good year
was marked by an increase of finery
and extravagance; a bad one by
debts and law-suits, depressions and
complaints&mdash;the country gaining nothing,
from year to year, for its labour
or its resources. And what is now
the consequence? The system which
occasioned the evil is now done away,
but the evil and its results remain.
The farmer, unknowing the cause at
first of the declension in his income,
went into debt, thinking, as had
often been the case before, that
a good year would follow a bad
one; and that he would be able
to retrieve by it. But the next year
came, and it was worse than the
former. He could not pay his debts,
and he was obliged to mortgage his
property, or sell his stock, to do so.
He could no longer get credit from
the shopkeeper, and he was unable
to purchase with cash the quantity or
the quality of goods he bought before.
The shopkeeper, in his turn depending
upon the custom of the farmer for the
sale of his goods, and depending upon
receiving his accounts from him to
meet his own, found both fail him
together; was obliged to curtail his
business to a miserable remnant; or
to shut up his shop, or to wait for
the sheriff to do it for him. Hence
the altered appearance of every part
of Canada, both town and country.
Hence the whole streets in Montreal
with hardly a single shop open. Hence
those sorry emblems of poverty and
retrogression&mdash;empty houses with
broken windows, and streets without
people, which may be seen in almost
every village in the provinces.</p>

<p>Now, for the system which has produced
this state of things, who is to
blame? Clearly and unmistakeably,
England. If the colonies, as is now
palpable to all America, have worked
but with one arm towards prosperity,
while the States have worked with
two, it was England's manufacturing
interests that tied the colonies' arm.
The colonies were, in this respect,
wholly in the hands of England. She
not only established a system for
them, by which the proceeds of every
acre of land they cleared, and every
tree they hewed, went to give work
to her poor, and wealth to her rich,
but she reserved the right of thinking
for them as well. Without her, they
must have naturally adopted the
course taken by the rest of America.
She legislated for them; they believed
her wise, and followed her dictates
without thought or apprehension.
They are injured; and she is to
blame.</p>

<p>But when Lord Chatham laid the
foundation of the system by which the
colonies have been, in effect, prevented
manufacturing for themselves, he
established mutuality of interests
between them and the mother country.
If he would have England's poor
employed, and England's capitalists
enriched by making goods for the
colonies, he would have the colonies
profit equally by protection in the
English markets. The partnership,
for such it really was, gave to each
country its own particular share of
benefits; and the system was such,
too, that the more the profits of the
one rose, though by its own individual
efforts, the more it was able to benefit
the other. For the more people engaged
in Canadian farming, the more
land that became cleared, and the more
timber that was got out, the more
English manufactures were consumed.
But we have shown, by comparison,
with the States, the disastrous
effect of this system upon the prosperity
of the colonies. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
shown, too, from its own character,
that it never was, and never
could have been, of any substantial
benefit to them; that it made them
extravagant, without leaving them
capital; that it made them to all
intents and purposes poorer, whilst
it was expected to make them richer.
And who was this system expressly
and avowedly intended to benefit?
Who were, in all seasons, and at all
times, whether good or bad for the
colonies, the only benefiters by it?
It was the manufacturers of England.
For if the colonies could buy but
prints and cottons, they bought of
these all they could pay for, and these
manufacturers had all the profit. If
they could buy broad cloths and silks,
they purchased as much as their crops
were worth, and often were induced
to draw upon the future, English
manufacturers and merchants getting
all the benefit. But after these manufacturers
had thus bled the colonies of
all their vitality, in the shape of capital,
for upwards of half a century&mdash;after
the colonies' right arm had been
tied up so long, for their express benefit,
that it became impotent from want
of exercise, these same manufacturers
turned round and told their colonial
partners&mdash;"We have now made all
we can out of you or, if we have not,
we think we can make a little more by
free trade than we can by keeping our
honest engagements with you. We
are sorry you have acquired a lamer
arm in our service. It is a pity. It
can't be helped now. Good-bye."
Yes, it was these manufacturers, who
so long bled the colonies, that turned
round to strike them in the end the
blow that should finish them. It was
their selfish agitation for years; it
was their constant sounding into the
ears of England one unvarying theme;
it was their disregard of all interests,
of all duties, and of all obligations
to all men, in one deadly, unwavering
struggle for the attainment
of one object, and for one class, that
cost the colonies their solemnly
pledged protection&mdash;that cost them,
we may add, their respect for the
honour and the justice of England.</p>

<p>But we have now, after a digression
which has been somewhat of the
longest, come to the point of our argument,
and that is this:&mdash;Upon a
question so vitally affecting the interests
of the colonies, upon a question
that might cost them the institutions
of England; upon a question where
all truth and justice demanded that
they should have been in a situation to
protect themselves against manufacturing
selfishness, does it not occur to the
reader, that the colonies should have
had a representation where it was decided?
The measures that exasperated
the old colonies to rebellion,
shrink into utter insignificance, as far
as injury or effect are concerned, in
comparison to this one. Here are three
millions of people, the main profits of
whose labour for upwards of fifty
years have gone to enrich a certain
class of people in England. And here
they are now, sacrificed to the selfishness
of that very class, without having
the opportunity of saying a word
for themselves. If the legislation of
England, for ten years past, has been
pregnant with vaster consequences to
her than the legislation of a century,
it has hardly affected her so deeply as
it has affected her North American
colonies. If her landowners see ruin,
in it&mdash;if her agricultural labourers see
in it the means of depriving them of
bread&mdash;still her other classes see, or
think they see, advantages in it to
counteract the evils, and prosperity to
balance the injury. But in England
all have been heard&mdash;all have contended,
where giant intellect sways as
well as mighty interests; where mind
has its influences as well as matter.
But in the colonies, where every interest
and every class saw, in imperial
legislation, injustice and ruin, neither
their intellect nor their interests availed
them anything. They were literally
placed in the legislative boat of England:
they found that they must either
sink or float in it; that legislation
happened to sink them; and though
they saw themselves going down, and
might, with their friends, have pulled
themselves ashore, they were not
allowed an oar to do so&mdash;they were
not in a situation to make an effort to
save themselves.</p>

<p>In the face of these deeply important
considerations, can it be fairly
said that the colonies have no interest
in imperial legislation, and that there
are no interests for imperial legislation
to guard in the colonies? Palpably to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
all the world, the States have been
making gigantic strides in prosperity,
while the colonies have been
standing still. Yet in the British
House of Commons, whenever the
question of the colonies has been
mooted, has it not been with the
view to consider how the colonies
could be made to consume more
English manufactures, rather than
how they should prosper by manufactures
of their own? Who has
urged the question there, that instead
of England's perpetually sending out
goods, and draining the colonies of all
the fruits of their labour, England
should send out people to make goods,
who in making them would make the
country? Yet this is the root of the
depression and the poverty of the
Canadas. And who with this vast
country's resources before him&mdash;with
its ways and means of making millions
independent, and with the vast facilities
for the investment of capital it
afforded and affords&mdash;can say that no
interests could spring up in it of consequence
to the legislation of England?</p>

<p>It is true that the colonies have
had their own parliaments; and it has
been imagined that these parliaments
encompassed the whole of their interests.
But when did the colonial
legislatures decide that the colonies
should not make a hob-nail for themselves?
Yet the want of making the
hob-nails has been the ruin of their
prosperity. It is estimated that the
colonies lose upwards of two hundred
thousand pounds a year by the loss
of protection: it is but too well known
how deeply this loss has affected them.
Yet whose legislation and policy educated
them literally to feel this loss?
whose interests were consulted in
giving the protection, and taking it
away again, that has been the cause
of all the evil? It was England's.
The colonies have been allowed by
their legislatures to shake the leaves
of their interests; imperial legislation
has always assailed the trunk.
But this is not all; colonial interests
have been, unheard and unheeded,
sacrificed to other interests in England.
The destiny of the colonies, without
question and without redress, has been
placed in the hands of men who have
made a convenience of their interests,
and an argument of their misfortunes,
brought about by these men themselves.
Nor could, nor ever can,
whatever may be imagined to the
contrary, the connexion of the colonies
be preserved with England, without
her policy and her legislation
vitally affecting them. For they
must be either English or American;
they must be, as they ever have
been, if the connexion is maintained,
made subservient to the interests of
England, or their interests must be
identified with hers: and if their interests
are identical, their legislation
should be identical also. It is impossible
that the flag of England can
long wave over what is all American.
If the colonies are to be wholly independent
in their interests of England,
it is in the very nature of things, that
their measures and their policy may
become, not only what England might
not like, but what might be an actual
injury to her; and what might owe
its very success, like much of the
policy of America, to its being detrimental
to her interests. And it is as
unnatural as it is absurd to suppose,
that England would or could, for any
length of time, extend her protection
over a people whose interests and
whose policy might be pulling against
her own, whose success might be
marked by her injury, and whose prosperity
might increase at the expense
of her adversity.</p>

<p>But, apart from the abstract right
of the colonies being represented
where they are, and, we insist, must
continue to be, so deeply concerned,
it is time the present humiliating
system of understanding their views
or feelings in the English parliament
should come to an end. Upon a
vitally important question to them&mdash;upon
one of these things that only come
up once in a century, or in a people's
whole history&mdash;take the following, as
an example of the way in which their
opinions and their interests were regarded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dishonesty of Public Men.</span> (<i>From
the London Post.</i>)&mdash;Mr Labouchere wished
to show that Canada chafed under the
restrictions of the Navigation Laws, and
that they would be satisfied with 'the
new commercial principle,' provided the
Navigation Laws were repealed. For
this purpose the minister took a course
which he would no more have thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
taking in the affairs of private life, than he
would have thought of taking purses on
the highway. The minister quoted the
statement of three respectable gentlemen
at Montreal, which coincided with his
views; and he did not let fall one word
from which the house could have inferred
that the opinions thus alluded to, were not
the general mercantile opinions of Montreal.
Now, the minister could scarcely
be ignorant that this question about free
trade, and the alteration of the Navigation
Laws, has been the subject of very
earnest discussion in Montreal; and he
cannot but have known that Mr Young
and Mr Holmes, however respectable in
their position, and influential in their business,
are the leaders of a small minority
of the body to which they belong. Mr
Labouchere read a statement to the House
of Commons, which he had the confidence
to call 'a proof irrefragable' of the
mercantile public opinion of Montreal and
Upper Canada, when the truth is&mdash;as
he could not but have known&mdash;that the
opinions of that statement are the opinions
of a few persons utterly opposed to
the general opinion of the mercantile
body. There was held in Montreal, on
the 17th of last month, the largest public
in-door meeting that ever assembled in
that city, at which a string of resolutions
was passed by acclamation, in favour of
the policy of protection, and against the
'new commercial principle' of the government.
That meeting was addressed
both by Mr Young and Mr Holmes. They
endeavoured to support the views held by
Mr Labouchere, but against the overwhelming
sense of the meeting, from
which they retired in complete discomfiture.
We are bound to suppose that the
minister who is head of the British Board
of Trade cannot but be aware of this;
and yet he not only conceals it altogether
from the House of Commons, but he reads
to that house the statement of Mr Young
and Mr Holmes, as 'proof irrefragable'
of the opinion of the colony of Canada, in
favour of the ministerial policy. The
President of the Board of Trade would as
soon cut off his right hand as do anything
of the kind in the ordinary concerns of
life; and yet so warped is he by party
politics&mdash;so desirous of obtaining a triumph
for the political bigotry which possessed
him&mdash;that he represents the mercantile
interest of Montreal and Upper
Canada as if it were decidedly on his
side, when, if he had told the whole story
fairly and honestly, he would have been
obliged to admit that exactly the contrary
was the fact."</p></div>

<p>Now, if it be necessary for England
to understand colonial feelings, and
opinions in order to legislate for them,
is this a fair or honourable way of
treating them? Are the interests of
these great provinces to be thus made
subservient to political trickery? Is
their destiny of so little importance to
Great Britain, that it should be even
in the very nature of things for any
man, or any party, in England, to have
it in his or their power thus to insult
their intellect as well as to violate
their interests? And is this circumstance
not a counterpart of others that
have from time to time occurred, when
Canadian subjects have been before
parliament? If we mistake not, upon
another vitally important question
to them&mdash;the corn laws&mdash;the petitions
and the remonstrances even of their
governor and their legislature were,
to enable misrepresentation and untruth
to have its influence in a
debate, kept back and concealed.
A party's interests in England were
at stake; the colonies were sacrificed.
Now, can it be reasonably urged, that
the allowing these colonies to speak
for themselves, and to be understood
for themselves, in that place and before
that people who literally hold their
destiny in their hands, would be pregnant
with more danger to England
than this dishonourable system is to
both her and to them? Would it not
be better to have them constitutionally
heard than surreptitiously represented?
Is it necessary to the understanding
of the wants and wishes of the colonies,
and to the good government of them,
that tricking and dishonesty should
triumph over truth and principle, and
that the legislative boons which reach
them should be filtered through falsehood
and deception? It will be in
the recollection of all who have read
the debate in the House of Lords upon
the Navigation Laws, how Lord Stanley
exposed these same Messrs Holmes
and Young, mentioned by Mr Labouchere,
but who, on this occasion,
in the Lords, were joined with a Mr
Knapp. It was shown by his lordship
that these eminent commercial
men (who seem to be the standing
correspondents of the present ministry,)
wrote what is called in America
a <i>bunkum</i> letter to Earl Grey, to be
used in the House of Lords, making a
grand flourish of their loyalty, and a
great case out in favour of the colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
secretary's side of the question. But
it was unfortunately, or rather fortunately,
discovered, that these eminent
individuals had been, at the very
same time, writing to their commercial
correspondents in London to shape
their business for an early annexation
of the colonies to the United States!
Yet it is upon such eminent testimony
as this that imperial legislation for the
colonies is founded. This is the way
England comes to a sufficient understanding
of a people's interests, to
shape a policy which may change their
whole political existence.</p>

<p>But, in addition to these reasons
why the colonies themselves should
be represented in England, there
may be reasons why England herself
might wish the same thing. May
it not be possible, nay, is it not the
fact, that a vast amount of trouble,
vexation, and expense might be
avoided by it? How many commissioners
sent out to find out difficulties
and to redress grievances,&mdash;how many
investigations before parliamentary
committees,&mdash;how many debates in
parliament,&mdash;how many expenses of
military operations, might have been
avoided, had these colonies been in a
situation from time to time to have
explained their own affairs, and to
have allowed their petty squabbles of
race and of faction to have escaped in
the safety-valves of imperial legislation?
In 1827, it cost England the
time and expense incident to a parliamentary
report, upon the civil
government of Lower Canada alone,
which extends over nearly five hundred
pages octavo. And this was irrespective,
of course, of the questions
and debates which led to it, besides
all that grew out of it. Next came
the debates upon the causes of the
failure of the remedies proposed in the
report&mdash;for the report itself turned out
to be like throwing a little water on a
large fire&mdash;it only served to increase
the blaze. Then came Lord Gosford,
with extensive powers to settle all
difficulties, and, it was hoped, with a
large capacity for understanding them.
But he, whatever else he did, succeeded
to admiration in bringing matters to a
head; or, being an Irishman, perhaps
he thought he would make things go
by contraries&mdash;for he came out to pacify
all parties, and he managed to leave
them all fighting. Next came the
debates upon, and the cost of, the
rebellion, and then rose the bright
star of Canadian hope and prosperity;
for the Earl of Durham was deputed,
with a large collection of wisdom, and
a pretty good sprinkling of other commodity
as well, to settle the whole
business. But, in sooth, these Canadians
must be a sad set, for he procured
them responsible government,
and this seems to have set them clean
into the fire.</p>

<p>Now, although it may be true that
the colonies might have had but few
interests at first to engage the attention
of imperial legislation, yet it
would have been far better to have
educated them to understand that
legislation, and to have appreciated
England's true greatness through her
institutions&mdash;and at the same time, to
have England taught, by practical
association and connexion with them,
their real worth&mdash;than to have had
English legislation largely and perpetually
wasted upon colonial broils,
and the colonies as perpetually dissatisfied
with English legislation. The
truth is, their system of international
legislation only made the two countries
known to each other by means
of their difficulties. The colonies
were never taught to look to the proceedings
of the imperial parliament,
unless when there was some broil to
settle, or some imperial question to
be decided, that was linked with colonial
ruin, and in the decision of which
the colonies had the interesting part
to play of looking on. Nor has England
ever thought of, or regarded the
colonies, except to hand them over
bodily to some subordinate in the
colonial office&mdash;unless when they were
forced upon her attention by her pride
being likely to be wounded by her
losing them, or by some other equally
disagreeable consideration. The legislative
intercourse between them has
ever been of the worst possible kind.
Instead of intending to teach the
people of England to respect, to rely
upon, and to appreciate the real worth
of the colonies, it has taught them to
underrate, to distrust, and to avoid
them. Instead of imperial legislation's
forming the character of the people,
as it has formed the character of the
people of England, and giving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
principles to cling to, and to hope
upon, it has directly tended to concentrate
their attention upon America,
and to alienate their feelings from
England.</p>

<p>But it is not alone in the passing of
laws, or in the arrangements of commerce,
or the harmonising and combining
of interests, that the colonies
would be benefited by imperial representation.
They would be benefited
a thousand times more by the intercourse
it would occasion between the
two countries. The colonies would
then be taught to regard England as
their home. They would read the
debates of her parliament as their own
debates; they would feel an interest
in her greatness, in her struggles, and
in her achievements, because they
would participate in their accomplishment.
The speeches of English statesmen&mdash;the
literature of England&mdash;her
institutions and her history, would
then be studied, understood, and appreciated
by them; and instead of the
colonies belonging to the greatest
empire in the world, and being the
most insignificant in legislation, they
would rise to the glory and dignity of
that empire of which they formed a
part&mdash;sharing in its intellectual greatness,
its rewards, and the respect that
is due to it from the world. Every
person, too, who represented the colonies
in England, would not simply be
the representatives of their public
policy, or national interests&mdash;he would
also represent their vast resources,
their thousand openings for the profitable
investment of capital, which the
people of England might benefit by as
much as the colonies. The public improvements
now abandoned in the
colonies for want of capital to carry
them on, and for want of sufficient
confidence in their government on the
part of capitalists, to invest their
money in them, would then become,
as similar improvements are in the
States, a wide field for English enterprise
to enrich itself in, and for English
poverty to shake off its misery
by. If the resources of the colonies&mdash;if
their means of making rich, and
being enriched, were understood and
taken advantage of&mdash;if international
legislation, common interests, and a
common destiny, could make the colonies
stand upon the same footing to
England as England does to herself,
God only call tell the vast amount
of human comfort, independence, and
happiness, that might result from the
consummation.</p>

<p>But how can these advantages
accrue to England, or to the colonies,
as long as it is understood that, the
moment a man plants his foot upon a
colony, that moment he yields up the
fee-simple of his forefathers' institutions&mdash;that
moment he takes, as it
were, a lease of them, conditioned to
hold them by chance, and to regard
them as a matter of temporary convenience
and necessity. And who
that has observed the tone of public
feeling in England for years, or the
spirit of the debates in her parliament,
can deny that this is the case?&mdash;who
that now lives in the colonies can
deny it? And with such an understanding
as this, and with all education
perpetually going on in colonial
legislatures, weaning the feelings and
separating the interests of the colonies
from the mother country, how
can it be expected that that interest
in England necessary to all true
loyalty, and that knowledge and appreciation
of her institutions necessary
to all enlightened or patriotic attachment,
can take root, or subsist for any
length of time in the colonies? If the
colonies, in truth, are to be made, or
to be kept British, in anything else
than in name&mdash;if even in name they
can long be kept so&mdash;it must be by
the infusion of the essential elements
of British character and British
principle into them, by means of
British legislation. If they are to be
part and parcel of the great oak, the
grafts must be nourished by the same
sap that supports the tree itself. The
little boat that is launched on the
great sea to shift for itself, must soon
be separated from the great ship.
The colonies, denied all practical participation
in the true greatness of
England, and having with them, by
virtue of their very name as colonies,
the prestige of instability and insecurity,
must, in the very nature of
things, be avoided by all who, though
they would be glad to trust the great
ship, cannot rely upon one of its frail
boats. The great wings of England's
legislation must be made to cover the
North American colonies, and to warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
them into a British existence; or they
will be doomed to stray and to wander,
and to be disrespected and uncared
for, until inevitable destiny at last
forces them under the wings of another.</p>

<p>Franklin, the profoundest thinker
of the many great men connected
with the American Revolution, thus
wrote upon this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The time has been when the colonies
might have been pleased with imperial
representation; they are now indifferent
about it; and if it is much longer delayed,
they will refuse it. But the pride of the
English people cannot bear the thought
of it, and therefore it will be delayed.
Every man in England seems to consider
himself as a piece of a sovereign over
America&mdash;seems to jostle himself into
the throne with the King, and talks of
<i>our subjects in the colonies</i>. The parliament
cannot well and wisely make
laws suited to the colonies, without being
properly and truly informed of their
circumstances, ability, temper, &amp;c. This
cannot be without representatives from
the colonies; yet the parliament of England
is fond of exercising this power, and
averse to the only means of acquiring
the necessary knowledge for exercising
it; which is desiring to be <i>omnipotent</i>
without being <i>omniscient</i>....
There remains among the
colonists so much respect, veneration, and
affection for Britain, that, if cultivated
prudently, with a kind usage, and tenderness
for their privileges, they might be
easily governed by England still for ages,
without force, or any considerable expense.
But I do not see there a sufficient
quantity of the wisdom that is necessary
to produce such a conduct, and I lament
the want of it."&mdash;<i>Letter to Lord Kames.</i></p></div>

<p>But it is most strange, that while
England's policy, and the spirit of her
legislation, have for some years past
clearly indicated to the world, that
she expected and seemed disposed to
pave the way for a separation between
herself and her colonies, her conduct
in other respects should be so opposed
to her views in this. For while she
was foreshadowing in her legislature
the independence of her colonies, she
was building, at a heavy expense,
garrisons in them to support her power
for all time to come. Within the ten
years last past, garrison quarters, upon
a large scale, have been built at Toronto;
and large sums have been laid out
upon every fort and place of defence
in the colonies. Surely this must
have been done with some other view
than making safe and convenient
places for the stars and stripes to
wave on in a few years! Yet when
we come to look back upon England's
legislation for the same period, and
upon the spirit evoked by the debates
in her parliament, it would really
seem, if she had any rational design
in these expenditures at all, that she
must have intended them for the express
benefit of her once rebellious son
Jonathan. England, by these defences,
would seem to say to the colonists&mdash;"Look
there, my lads, and see
the emblems of your protection, and of
British rule in America for ever." By
her legislation and free trade policy,
she has unequivocally told them,
"that she must buy her bread where
she pleases; and they may find a
government where they please." With
one hand she has taken her colonies
by the shoulder, and told them they
must behave themselves: with the
other, she has shaken hands with
them, and told them they may kick
up their heels as they please for all
she cares.</p>

<p>But there is a question, upon the
satisfactory answering of which rests
the whole matter of whether the colonies
can, or cannot, continue connected
with Great Britain. And that question
is, can they prosper in proportion
to their abilities to prosper, by
that connexion?</p>

<p>We have already partially answered
it by showing the benefit that would
inevitably accrue to the colonies from
their being represented in the imperial
parliament&mdash;by their whole property
and worth being, by this means,
placed in the market of the world side
by side with the property and worth
of England herself; and by England's
capital partially, if not to all intents
and purposes, flowing into the colonies
upon the same footing that it flows
through England&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, upon the
principle of advantageous investment.
But we shall prove that they can and
should prosper, to the fullest extent
of their capabilities, in connexion
with Britain, in another way.</p>

<p>It is admitted, on all hands, that
were their connexion with England
broken off, and were the colonies to
become, as it is certain they would,
several States of the American Union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
they would prosper, in proportion to
their capabilities, equally with any of
the northern states having no greater
advantages in soil or resources. It is
thought, and we believe with truth,
that the public improvements which
now lie dormant for want of capital to
carry them on, or for want of sufficient
knowledge of, or confidence in, the
colonies from without, to induce the
necessary capital to be advanced for
them, would be completed, if the
colonies were joined to the States. It
is thought, too, and with equal propriety,
that Lower Canada, whose
population is singularly well fitted to
prosper and be benefited by manufactures,
would, were it a State, be
directed in that course most conducive
to its prosperity. And it is
thought&mdash;likewise correctly&mdash;that the
great resources of Upper Canada,
were that province too a State,
would become greatly more available
than they now are: its population
would increase; its cities and towns
enlarge; and every man having an
acre of land, or a lot in a town in it,
would become much better off than he
is at present. This, if the States remain
united as they have been, and
prosper as they have done, might be
all strictly true. But why is it that
the colonies believe this, and that the
States are also of the same opinion? It
is because the colonies know what the
Americans are, and the Americans
know what the colonies are capable of.
They understand each other, and
they know how they could work together
for good.</p>

<p>But what means would the Americans
employ to develop the undeveloped
resources of the colonies, and to secure
wealth to themselves, while they
brought prosperity to them? They
would simply employ their capital in
them; and they know that it could,
and they would see that it should, be
so employed as to secure these results.</p>

<p>But let us now inquire,&mdash;Is it impossible
to employ the capital of England
in these colonies, so as to effect the
same thing? If American enterprise
and skill could cause wealth to spring
up in Lower Canada, and could enrich
itself by doing so, is it impossible for
English enterprise and skill to do
likewise? If American capitalists
could, beyond any manner of question,
accumulate wealth for themselves,
and vastly benefit the Canadas,
by constructing railroads through them,
or rather by continuing their own,
is it out of the power of English capitalists
to be enriched by the same
process? If the Canadas, as we have
said, believe the States can infuse
prosperity into them, because they
see the States understand them, and
know what they are capable of, is it
impossible for England to understand
them also, and to take advantage of
their worth? But then, it will be answered,
there is the difficulty of colonial
government. Who will invest
his capital for a period of fifteen or
twenty years, where he may be paid
off by a revolution&mdash;when, as Moore
said of the old colonies&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"England's debtors might be changed to
England's foes?"</p></div>

<p>But suppose the stability of England's
own government were imparted
to the colonies, suppose the permanency
and the interests of England
became effectually and for ever identified
with them&mdash;what then? That
there is no reason under heaven left
why they should not prosper, to the
fullest extent of their ability to prosper,
and that England might not be
benefited by them in proportion.</p>

<p>But even this is but a partial view
of the case; for the Americans would
actually borrow the money in England
that they would invest in the
colonies, and yet enrich themselves by
doing so. The colonies, in truth&mdash;joined
to the States&mdash;would prosper
by diluted benefits, the Americans
reaping all the advantages of the dilution.
Connected with Great Britain&mdash;did
Britain confide in them as
she might, and understand them as
she should, and were they in a situation
to inspire that confidence, and to
occasion that understanding&mdash;they
must inevitably reap, in many respects,
double the benefits they would
enjoy with the States.</p>

<p><i>But the States would benefit the colonies
all they could. Will England?</i></p>

<p>The scheme of imperial representation
for the North American colonies
may be, and doubtless is, open to
many objections; and many difficulties
would have to be got over before
it could be accomplished. The first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
if not the only great difficulty, is&mdash;Would
the colonies bear the burden
of taxation, and the responsibility of
being part and parcel of the British
empire, for better or for worse, for
all time to come? And could they, if
they would?</p>

<p>In considering these questions, it is
but fair to view them, not only in regard
to the responsibilities the system
we propose would entail, but also in
regard to the responsibilities they
would and must incur by any other
system they might adopt. For this
may be taken for granted&mdash;they must
soon become all American, or all English.
They must enjoy English credit
and English permanency, or they must
have some other. A great country,
with an industrious, enterprising
people, cannot long remain without
credit, without prosperity, and without
either the use or the hope of capital.
The Canadas are now in this
situation.</p>

<p>If, then, the colonies should become
independent, and it were possible for
them to continue so, they would have
to pay for their own protection. And
if they became a republic, they would
have to take their stand with the
other powers of the world, and bear
the expense of doing so. If, on the
other hand, they were taken into the
American Union, they would have to
contribute, in addition to the cost of
their own local or state governments,
to the support of the general government
of the whole Union; they would
have, too, to contribute to the forming
a navy for the States, such as England
has now got; and they would be
obliged to contribute, too, for the construction
of military defences for
America, which England is pretty
well supplied with. They would have,
in short, to expend upon America a
great deal of what England, in three
or four centuries, has been expending
upon herself as a nation.</p>

<p>It may also be fairly presumed,
that, with interests every day becoming
more independent of England;
with a system of government which
leaves England nothing in America
but a name&mdash;or, as Lord Elgin says,
a "dignified neutrality," and which
really means a dignified nothingness&mdash;with
a system of government such as
this, every sensible man must foresee
that England will soon get tired of
paying largely for the support of her
dignified nothingness in America;
that she will&mdash;as indeed she has already
done&mdash;inquire what right or
occasion she has for protecting colonies
from their enemies from without,
or, what is much more serious to her,
from themselves within, when she has
ceased to have a single interest in
commerce with them; and when she
must see&mdash;if the present system be
kept up much longer&mdash;that every day
must separate her still more widely
from them in feeling, and in all the essential
principles that bind a people to
each other, or a colony to a mother
country?</p>

<p>In view, therefore, of all these considerations,
taken separately or together,
it is but reasonable to suppose
that the colonies may soon be called
upon to pay for their own protection
from their enemies from without, or
for their own squabbles within, if
they must indulge in such expensive
amusements. And the question then
arises&mdash;Would their being practically
identified with the British empire,
participating in all its greatness,
and enjoying the prestige of its stability
and its credit, entail upon them
greater cost or responsibility, than
they would have to incur to maintain
a puny, helpless independence, or in
becoming states of the American
Union?</p>

<p>It is out of our power to make the
calculation, as it is impossible for us
to know upon what terms England
would agree to the colonies participating
in her government as we propose.
It is likewise impossible for us
to tell how much might be saved by
removing the tea-pots, so pregnant
with tempests, in the shape of colonial
legislatures; in removing governors
to preserve "<i>dignified neutrality</i>;"
and courts to keep up the shadow of
England's government in America,
the substance having grown "beautifully
less" of late years. But after
much thought and investigation, by
both ourselves and others better
accustomed to such matters than we
are, we have come to the conclusion&mdash;that
imperial representation might
cost the colonies nothing more, if as
much, as any other change they would
have to make; that England would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
gain immensely by the change; and
that the proceeds of the vast tracts of
country lying north and north-west
of the Canadas, their fisheries, their
mineral resources, and their other
unused and unappropriated wealth in
timber and other things, might be
converted into a sinking fund by the
united governments of England and
her colonies, that, in its effects, might
astonish both England and the world.
We can but throw out the suggestion;
it is for others to consider it.</p>

<p>But if the connexion of the colonies
with Great Britain is to be made a
mere matter of time and convenience,
as to when it shall end, or how, then
it is of little use in hoping much, or
thinking deeply, upon what may be
pregnant with such vast consequences
to England's race in America, and
even America's own race in it. A time,
it would seem, which has taught
Britons to know what their institutions
are worth, must cost them in
America these institutions. A time,
which has exhibited, during the principal
settlement of the Canadas, the
fall alike of the fabric of the political
enthusiast and the fortress of the
despot in Europe, must cost, it seems,
the colonies that government which
bore freedom aloft through the wild
storm. England has stood upon a
rock, and, after pointing out to her
colonies the wreck of human institutions,
she is about to push them off
to share the fate she has taught them
so much to dread. If England has
the heart to do it, it must be done.
Three millions of people will cease to
say "God save the Queen!" The
sun will set upon her empire. Full
many an honest tear will be shed at
hearing that it must. Full many a
heart will be torn from what it would
but too gladly die for. But the days
of chivalry are gone; the days of
memory are fled. The selfish, mercenary
nineteenth century will be
marked with the loss of the best jewel
in Britain's crown.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ENGLISH_MAIL-COACH_OR_THE_GLORY_OF_MOTION" id="THE_ENGLISH_MAIL-COACH_OR_THE_GLORY_OF_MOTION">THE ENGLISH MAIL-COACH, OR THE GLORY OF MOTION.</a></h2>


<p>Some twenty or more years before
I matriculated at Oxford, Mr Palmer,
M.P. for Bath, had accomplished two
things, very hard to do on our little
planet, the Earth, however cheap they
may happen to be held by the eccentric
people in comets: he had invented
mail-coaches, and he had married the
daughter<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of a duke. He was, therefore,
just twice as great a man as Galileo,
who certainly invented (or <i>discovered</i>)
the satellites of Jupiter, those
very next things extant to mail-coaches
in the two capital points of speed and
keeping time, but who did <i>not</i> marry
the daughter of a duke.</p>

<p>These mail-coaches, as organised
by Mr Palmer, are entitled to a circumstantial
notice from myself&mdash;having
had so large a share in developing
the anarchies of my subsequent dreams,
an agency which they accomplished,
first, through velocity, at that time
unprecedented; they first revealed the
glory of motion: suggesting, at the
same time, an under-sense, not unpleasurable,
of possible though indefinite
danger; secondly, through grand
effects for the eye between lamp-light
and the darkness upon solitary roads;
thirdly, through animal beauty and
power so often displayed in the class
of horses selected for this mail service;
fourthly, through the conscious
presence of a central intellect, that, in
the midst of vast distances,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of storms,
of darkness, of night, overruled all
obstacles into one steady co-operation
in a national result. To my own feeling,
this Post-office service recalled
some mighty orchestra, where a thousand
instruments, all disregarding each
other, and so far in danger of discord,
yet all obedient as slaves to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>supreme <i>baton</i> of some great leader,
terminate in a perfection of harmony
like that of heart, veins, and arteries,
in a healthy animal organisation. But,
finally, that particular element in this
whole combination which most impressed
myself, and through which it
is that to this hour Mr Palmer's mail-coach
system tyrannises by terror and
terrific beauty over my dreams, lay in
the awful political mission which at
that time it fulfilled. The mail-coaches
it was that distributed over the face
of the land, like the opening of apocalyptic
vials, the heart-shaking news
of Trafalgar, of Salamanca, of Vittoria,
of Waterloo. These were the harvests
that, in the grandeur of their
reaping, redeemed the tears and blood
in which they had been sown. Neither
was the meanest peasant so much below
the grandeur and the sorrow of the
times as to confound these battles,
which were gradually moulding the
destinies of Christendom, with the vulgar
conflicts of ordinary warfare, which
are oftentimes but gladiatorial trials
of national prowess. The victories of
England in this stupendous contest
rose of themselves as natural <i>Te Deums</i>
to heaven; and it was felt by the
thoughtful that such victories, at such
a crisis of general prostration, were
not more beneficial to ourselves than
finally to France, and to the nations
of western and central Europe, through
whose pusillanimity it was that the
French domination had prospered.</p>

<p>The mail-coach, as the national
organ for publishing these mighty
events, became itself a spiritualised
and glorified object to an impassioned
heart; and naturally, in the Oxford
of that day, all hearts were awakened.
There were, perhaps, of us gownsmen,
two thousand <i>resident</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in Oxford,
and dispersed through five-and-twenty
colleges. In some of these the custom
permitted the student to keep what
are called "short terms;" that is, the
four terms of Michaelmas, Lent,
Easter, and Act, were kept severally
by a residence, in the aggregate, of
ninety-one days, or thirteen weeks.
Under this interrupted residence,
accordingly, it was possible that a
student might have a reason for going
down to his home four times in the
year. This made eight journeys to
and fro. And as these homes lay
dispersed through all the shires of the
island, and most of us disdained all
coaches except his majesty's mail, no
city out of London could pretend to
so extensive a connexion with Mr
Palmer's establishment as Oxford.
Naturally, therefore, it became a
point of some interest with us, whose
journeys revolved every six weeks on
an average, to look a little into the
executive details of the system. With
some of these Mr Palmer had no concern;
they rested upon bye-laws not
unreasonable, enacted by posting-houses
for their own benefit, and upon
others equally stern, enacted by the
inside passengers for the illustration
of their own exclusiveness. These last
were of a nature to rouse our scorn,
from which the transition was not
<i>very long</i> to mutiny. Up to this time,
it had been the fixed assumption of
the four inside people, (as an old tradition
of all public carriages from the
reign of Charles II.,) that they, the
illustrious quaternion, constituted a
porcelain variety of the human race,
whose dignity would have been compromised
by exchanging one word of
civility with the three miserable delf
ware outsides. Even to have kicked
an outsider might have been held to
attaint the foot concerned in that operation;
so that, perhaps, it would have
required an act of parliament to restore
its purity of blood. What words,
then, could express the horror, and
the sense of treason, in that case,
which <i>had</i> happened, where all three
outsides, the trinity of Pariahs, made
a vain attempt to sit down at the
same breakfast-table or dinner-table
with the consecrated four? I myself
witnessed such an attempt; and on
that occasion a benevolent old gentleman
endeavoured to soothe his three
holy associates, by suggesting that, if
the outsides were indicted for this
criminal attempt at the next assizes,
the court would regard it as a case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>lunacy (or <i>delirium tremens</i>) rather
than of treason. England owes much
of her grandeur to the depth of the
aristocratic element in her social composition.
I am not the man to laugh
at it. But sometimes it expressed
itself in extravagant shapes. The
course taken with the infatuated outsiders,
in the particular attempt which
I have noticed, was, that the waiter,
beckoning them away from the privileged
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>, sang out, "This
way, my good men;" and then enticed
them away off to the kitchen. But
that plan had not always answered.
Sometimes, though very rarely, cases
occurred where the intruders, being
stronger than usual, or more vicious
than usual, resolutely refused to move,
and so far carried their point, as to
have a separate table arranged for
themselves in a corner of the room.
Yet, if an Indian screen could be found
ample enough to plant them out from
the very eyes of the high table, or
<i>dais</i>, it then became possible to assume
as a fiction of law&mdash;that the
three delf fellows, after all, were not
present. They could be ignored by the
porcelain men, under the maxim, that
objects not appearing, and not existing,
are governed by the same logical
construction.</p>

<p>Such now being, at that time, the
usages of mail-coaches, what was to
be done by us of young Oxford? We,
the most aristocratic of people, who
were addicted to the practice of looking
down superciliously even upon the
insides themselves as often very suspicious
characters, were we voluntarily
to court indignities? If our dress and
bearing sheltered us, generally, from
the suspicion of being "raff," (the
name at that period for "snobs,"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>)
we really <i>were</i> such constructively, by
the place we assumed. If we did not
submit to the deep shadow of eclipse,
we entered at least the skirts of its
penumbra. And the analogy of theatres
was urged against us, where no man
can complain of the annoyances incident
to the pit or gallery, having his
instant remedy in paying the higher
price of the boxes. But the soundness
of this analogy we disputed. In
the case of the theatre, it cannot be
pretended that the inferior situations
have any separate attractions, unless
the pit suits the purpose of the dramatic
reporter. But the reporter or
critic is a rarity. For most people,
the sole benefit is in the price. Whereas,
on the contrary, the outside of the
mail had its own incommunicable advantages.
These we could not forego.
The higher price we should willingly
have paid, but <i>that</i> was connected with
the condition of riding inside, which
was insufferable. The air, the freedom
of prospect, the proximity to the
horses, the elevation of seat&mdash;these
were what we desired; but, above all,
the certain anticipation of purchasing
occasional opportunities of driving.</p>

<p>Under coercion of this great practical
difficulty, we instituted a searching
inquiry into the true quality and
valuation of the different apartments
about the mail. We conducted this
inquiry on metaphysical principles;
and it was ascertained satisfactorily,
that the roof of the coach, which some
had affected to call the attics, and
some the garrets, was really the drawing-room,
and the box was the chief
ottoman or sofa in that drawing-room;
whilst it appeared that the
inside, which had been traditionally
regarded as the only room tenantable
by gentlemen, was, in fact, the coal-cellar
in disguise.</p>

<p>Great wits jump. The very same
idea had not long before struck the
celestial intellect of China. Amongst
the presents carried out by our first
embassy to that country was a state-coach.
It had been specially selected
as a personal gift by George III.; but
the exact mode of using it was a
mystery to Pekin. The ambassador,
indeed, (Lord Macartney) had made
some dim and imperfect explanations
upon the point; but as his excellency
communicated these in a diplomatic
whisper, at the very moment of his
departure, the celestial mind was very
feebly illuminated, and it became
necessary to call a cabinet council on
the grand state question&mdash;"Where
was the emperor to sit?" The hammer-cloth
happened to be unusually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>gorgeous; and partly on that consideration,
but partly also because the
box offered the most elevated seat,
and undeniably went foremost, it was
resolved by acclamation that the box
was the imperial place, and, <i>for the
scoundrel who drove, he might sit
where he could find a perch</i>. The
horses, therefore, being harnessed,
under a flourish of music and a salute
of guns, solemnly his imperial majesty
ascended his new English throne,
having the first lord of the treasury
on his right hand, and the chief jester
on his left. Pekin gloried in the spectacle;
and in the whole flowery
people, constructively present by representation,
there was but one discontented
person, which was the
coachman. This mutinous individual,
looking as blackhearted as he really
was, audaciously shouted&mdash;"Where
am <i>I</i> to sit?" But the privy council,
incensed by his disloyalty, unanimously
opened the door, and kicked
him into the inside. He had all the
inside places to himself; but such is the
rapacity of ambition, that he was still
dissatisfied. "I say," he cried out in
an extempore petition, addressed to
the emperor through a window, "how
am I to catch hold of the reins?"&mdash;"Any
how," was the answer; "don't
trouble <i>me</i>, man, in my glory; through
the windows, through the key-holes&mdash;how
you please." Finally, this
contumacious coachman lengthened
the checkstrings into a sort of jury-reins,
communicating with the horses;
with these he drove as steadily as
may be supposed. The emperor returned
after the briefest of circuits:
he descended in great pomp from his
throne, with the severest resolution
never to remount it. A public thanksgiving
was ordered for his majesty's
prosperous escape from the disease of
a broken neck; and the state-coach
was dedicated for ever as a votive
offering to the God Fo, Fo&mdash;whom the
learned more accurately call Fi, Fi.</p>

<p>A revolution of this same Chinese
character did young Oxford of that
era effect in the constitution of mail-coach
society. It was a perfect
French revolution; and we had good
reason to say, <i>Ca ira</i>. In fact, it
soon became <i>too</i> popular. The "public,"
a well known character, particularly
disagreeable, though slightly
respectable, and notorious for affecting
the chief seats in synagogues, had
at first loudly opposed this revolution;
but when all opposition showed
itself to be ineffectual, our disagreeable
friend went into it with headlong zeal.
At first it was a sort of race between
us; and, as the public is usually above
30, (say generally from 30 to 50 years
old,) naturally we of young Oxford,
that averaged about 20, had the advantage.
Then the public took to
bribing, giving fees to horse-keepers,
&amp;c., who hired out their persons as
warming-pans on the box-seat. <i>That</i>,
you know, was shocking to our moral
sensibilities. Come to bribery, we
observed, and there is an end to all
morality, Aristotle's, Cicero's, or anybody's.
And, besides, of what use
was it? For <i>we</i> bribed also. And
as our bribes to those of the public
being demonstrated out of Euclid to
be as five shillings to sixpence, here
again young Oxford had the advantage.
But the contest was ruinous to
the principles of the stable-establishment
about the mails. The whole
corporation was constantly bribed,
rebribed, and often sur-rebribed; so
that a horse-keeper, ostler, or helper,
was held by the philosophical at that
time to be the most corrupt character
in the nation.</p>

<p>There was an impression upon the
public mind, natural enough from the
continually augmenting velocity of
the mail, but quite erroneous, that an
outside seat on this class of carriages
was a post of danger. On the contrary,
I maintained that, if a man had
become nervous from some gipsy prediction
in his childhood, allocating to
a particular moon now approaching
some unknown danger, and he should
inquire earnestly,&mdash;"Whither can I
go for shelter? Is a prison the safest
retreat? Or a lunatic, hospital? Or
the British Museum?" I should have
replied&mdash;"Oh, no; I'll tell you what
to do. Take lodgings for the next
forty days on the box of his majesty's
mail. Nobody can touch you there.
If it is by bills at ninety days after
date that you are made unhappy&mdash;if
noters and protesters are the sort of
wretches whose astrological shadows
darken the house of life&mdash;then note
you what I vehemently protest, viz.,
that no matter though the sheriff in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
every county should be running after
you with his <i>posse</i>, touch a hair of
your head he cannot whilst you keep
house, and have your legal domicile,
on the box of the mail. It's felony
to stop the mail; even the sheriff
cannot do that. And an <i>extra</i> (no
great matter if it grazes the sheriff)
touch of the whip to the leaders at
any time guarantees your safety." In
fact, a bed-room in a quiet house
seems a safe enough retreat; yet it is
liable to its own notorious nuisances,
to robbers by night, to rats, to fire.
But the mail laughs at these terrors.
To robbers, the answer is packed up
and ready for delivery in the barrel of
the guard's blunderbuss. Rats again!
there <i>are</i> none about mail-coaches,
any more than snakes in Von Troil's
Iceland; except, indeed, now and
then a parliamentary rat, who always
hides his shame in the "coal-cellar."
And, as to fire, I never knew but one
in a mail-coach, which was in the
Exeter mail, and caused by an obstinate
sailor bound to Devonport.
Jack, making light of the law and
the lawgiver that had set their
faces against his offence, insisted
on taking up a forbidden seat in the
rear of the roof, from which he
could exchange his own yarns with
those of the guard. No greater
offence was then known to mail-coaches;
it was treason, it was <i>l&aelig;sa
majestas</i>, it was by tendency arson;
and the ashes of Jack's pipe, falling
amongst the straw of the hinder boot,
containing the mail-bags, raised a
flame which (aided by the wind of
our motion) threatened a revolution
in the republic of letters. But even
this left the sanctity of the box unviolated.
In dignified repose, the
coachman and myself sat on, resting
with benign composure upon our
knowledge&mdash;that the fire would have
to burn its way through four inside
passengers before it could reach ourselves.
With a quotation rather too
trite, I remarked to the coachman,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;&mdash;"Jam proximus ardet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ucalegon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, recollecting that the Virgilian
part of his education might have been
neglected, I interpreted so far as to
say, that perhaps at that moment the
flames were catching hold of our
worthy brother and next-door neighbour
Ucalegon. The coachman said
nothing, but by his faint sceptical
smile he seemed to be thinking that
he knew better; for that in fact, Ucalegon,
as it happened, was not in the
way-bill.</p>

<p>No dignity is perfect which does
not at some point ally itself with the
indeterminate and mysterious. The
connexion of the mail with the state
and the executive government&mdash;a
connexion obvious, but yet not strictly
defined&mdash;gave to the whole mail establishment
a grandeur and an official
authority which did us service on the
roads, and invested us with seasonable
terrors. But perhaps these
terrors were not the less impressive,
because their exact legal limits were
imperfectly ascertained. Look at
those turnpike gates; with what deferential
hurry, with what an obedient
start, they fly open at our approach!
Look at that long line of carts and
carters ahead, audaciously usurping
the very crest of the road: ah! traitors,
they do not hear us as yet, but
as soon as the dreadful blast of our
horn reaches them with the proclamation
of our approach, see with what
frenzy of trepidation they fly to their
horses' heads, and deprecate our
wrath by the precipitation of their
crane-neck quarterings. Treason they
feel to be their crime; each individual
carter feels himself under the ban of
confiscation and attainder: his blood
is attainted through six generations,
and nothing is wanting but the heads-man
and his axe, the block and the
sawdust, to close up the vista of his
horrors. What! shall it be within
benefit of clergy, to delay the king's
message on the highroad?&mdash;to interrupt
the great respirations, ebb or
flood, of the national intercourse&mdash;to
endanger the safety of tidings
running day and night between all
nations and languages? Or can it
be fancied, amongst the weakest of
men, that the bodies of the criminals
will be given up to their widows for
Christian burial? Now, the doubts
which were raised as to our powers
did more to wrap them in terror, by
wrapping them in uncertainty; than
could have been effected by the
sharpest definitions of the law from
the Quarter Sessions. We, on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
parts, (we, the collective mail, I
mean,) did our utmost to exalt the
idea of our privileges by the insolence
with which we wielded them. Whether
this insolence rested upon law
that gave it a sanction, or upon conscious
power, haughtily dispensing
with that sanction, equally it spoke
from a potential station; and the
agent in each particular insolence of
the moment, was viewed reverentially,
as one having authority.</p>

<p>Sometimes after breakfast his majesty's
mail would become frisky; and
in its difficult wheelings amongst the
intricacies of early markets, it would
upset an apple-cart, a cart loaded
with eggs, &amp;c. Huge was the affliction
and dismay, awful was the smash,
though, after all, I believe the damage
might be levied upon the hundred.
I, as far as was possible, endeavoured
in such a case to represent the conscience
and moral sensibilities of the
mail; and, when wildernesses of eggs
were lying poached under our horses'
hoofs, then would I stretch forth my
hands in sorrow, saying (in words too
celebrated in those days from the
false<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> echoes of Marengo)&mdash;"Ah!
wherefore have we not time to weep
over you?" which was quite impossible,
for in fact we had not even time
to laugh over them. Tied to post-office
time, with an allowance in some
cases of fifty minutes for eleven miles,
could the royal mail pretend to undertake
the offices of sympathy and condolence?
Could it be expected to provide
tears for the accidents of the road? If
even it seemed to trample on humanity,
it did so, I contended, in discharge of
its own more peremptory duties.</p>

<p>Upholding the morality of the mail, <i>&agrave;
fortiori</i> I upheld its rights, I stretched
to the uttermost its privilege of imperial
precedency, and astonished weak minds
by the feudal powers which I hinted
to be lurking constructively in the
charters of this proud establishment.
Once I remember being on the box of
the Holyhead mail, between Shrewsbury
and Oswestry, when a tawdry
thing from Birmingham, some <i>Tallyho</i>
or <i>Highflier</i>, all flaunting with green
and gold, came up alongside of us.
What a contrast to our royal simplicity
of form and colour is this plebeian
wretch! The single ornament on our
dark ground of chocolate colour was
the mighty shield of the imperial
arms, but emblazoned in proportions
as modest as a signet-ring bears to a
seal of office. Even this was displayed
only on a single pannel, whispering,
rather than proclaiming, our relations
to the state; whilst the beast from
Birmingham had as much writing
and painting on its sprawling flanks
as would have puzzled a decipherer
from the tombs of Luxor. For some
time this Birmingham machine ran
along by our side,&mdash;a piece of familiarity
that seemed to us sufficiently
jacobinical. But all at once a movement
of the horses announced a desperate
intention of leaving us behind.
"Do you see <i>that</i>?" I said to the
coachman. "I see," was his short
answer. He was awake, yet he waited
longer than seemed prudent; for the
horses of our audacious opponent had
a disagreeable air of freshness and
power. But his motive was loyal;
his wish was that the Birmingham
conceit should be full-blown before he
froze it. When <i>that</i> seemed ripe, he
unloosed, or, to speak by a stronger
image, he sprang his known resources,
he slipped our royal horses like
cheetahs, or hunting leopards after the
affrighted game. How they could
retain such a reserve of fiery power
after the work they had accomplished,
seemed hard to explain. But on our
side, besides the physical superiority,
was a tower of strength, namely, the
king's name, "which they upon the
adverse faction wanted." Passing
them without an effort, as it seemed,
we threw them into the rear with so
lengthening an interval between us,
as proved in itself the bitterest mockery
of their presumption; whilst our
guard blew back a shattering blast of
triumph, that was really too painfully
full of derision.</p>

<p>I mention this little incident for its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>connexion with what followed. A
Welshman, sitting behind me, asked
if I had not felt my heart burn within
me during the continuance of the
race? I said&mdash;No; because we were
not racing with a mail, so that no
glory could be gained. In fact, it
was sufficiently mortifying that such
a Birmingham thing should dare to
challenge us. The Welshman replied,
that he didn't see <i>that</i>; for that
a cat might look at a king, and a
Brummagem coach might lawfully
race the Holyhead mail. "<i>Race</i> us
perhaps," I replied, "though even
<i>that</i> has an air of sedition, but not
<i>beat</i> us. This would have been treason;
and for its own sake I am glad
that the Tallyho was disappointed."
So dissatisfied did the Welshman
seem with this opinion, that at last I
was obliged to tell him a very fine
story from one of our elder dramatists,
viz.&mdash;that once, in some Oriental
region, when the prince of all
the land, with his splendid court,
were flying their falcons, a hawk
suddenly flew at a majestic eagle; and
in defiance of the eagle's prodigious
advantages, in sight also of all the
astonished field-sportsmen, spectators,
and followers, killed him on the
spot. The prince was struck with
amazement at the unequal contest,
and with burning admiration for its
unparalleled result. He commanded
that the hawk should be brought
before him; caressed the bird with
enthusiasm, and ordered that, for the
commemoration of his matchless
courage, a crown of gold should be
solemnly placed on the hawk's head;
but then that, immediately after this
coronation, the bird should be led off
to execution, as the most valiant
indeed of traitors, but not the less a
traitor that had dared to rise in rebellion
against his liege lord the eagle.
"Now," said I to the Welshman,
"how painful it would have been to
you and me as men of refined feelings,
that this poor brute, the Tallyho, in
the impossible case of a victory over
us, should have been crowned with
jewellery, gold, with Birmingham
ware, or paste diamonds, and then
led off to instant execution." The
Welshman doubted if that could be
warranted by law. And when I hinted
at the 10th of Edward III. chap. 15,
for regulating the precedency of
coaches, as being probably the statute
relied on for the capital punishment
of such offences, he replied drily&mdash;That
if the attempt to pass a mail was
really treasonable, it was a pity that
the Tallyho appeared to have so imperfect
an acquaintance with law.</p>

<p>These were among the gaieties of my
earliest and boyish acquaintance with
mails. But alike the gayest and the
most terrific of my experiences rose
again after years of slumber, armed
with preternatural power to shake my
dreaming sensibilities; sometimes, as
in the slight case of Miss Fanny on
the Bath road, (which I will immediately
mention,) through some casual
or capricious association with images
originally gay, yet opening at some
stage of evolution into sudden capacities
of horror; sometimes through
the more natural and fixed alliances
with the sense of power so various
lodged in the mail system.</p>

<p>The modern modes of travelling
cannot compare with the mail-coach
system in grandeur and power. They
boast of more velocity, but not however
as a consciousness, but as a fact of
our lifeless knowledge, resting upon
<i>alien</i> evidence, as, for instance, because
somebody <i>says</i> that we have
gone fifty miles in the hour, or upon
the evidence of a result, as that actually
we find ourselves in York four
hours after leaving London. Apart
from such an assertion, or such a result,
I am little aware of the pace. But,
seated on the old mail-coach, we needed
no evidence out of ourselves to
indicate the velocity. On this system
the word was&mdash;<i>Non magna loquimur</i>,
as upon railways, but <i>magna vivimus</i>.
The vital experience of the glad animal
sensibilities made doubts impossible
on the question of our speed;
we heard our speed, we saw it, we felt
it as a thrilling; and this speed was
not the product of blind insensate
agencies, that had no sympathy to
give, but was incarnated in the fiery
eyeballs of an animal, in his dilated
nostril, spasmodic muscles, and echoing
hoofs. This speed was incarnated
in the <i>visible</i> contagion amongst brutes
of some impulse, that, radiating into
<i>their</i> natures, had yet its centre and
beginning in man. The sensibility of
the horse uttering itself in the maniac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
light of his eye, might be the last
vibration in such a movement; the
glory of Salamanca might be the first&mdash;but
the intervening link that connected
them, that spread the earthquake
of the battle into the eyeball of
the horse, was the heart of man&mdash;kindling
in the rapture of the fiery
strife, and then propagating its own
tumults by motions and gestures to
the sympathies, more or less dim, in
his servant the horse.</p>

<p>But now, on the new system of
travelling, iron tubes and boilers have
disconnected man's heart from the
ministers of his locomotion. Nile nor
Trafalgar has power any more to raise
an extra bubble in a steam-kettle.
The galvanic cycle is broken up for
ever; man's imperial nature no longer
sends itself forward through the electric
sensibility of the horse; the inter-agencies
are gone in the mode of communication
between the horse and his
master, out of which grew so many
aspects of sublimity under accidents
of mists that hid, or sudden blazes
that revealed, of mobs that agitated,
or midnight solitudes that awed. Tidings,
fitted to convulse all nations,
must henceforwards travel by culinary
process; and the trumpet that once
announced from afar the laurelled mail,
heart-shaking, when heard screaming
on the wind, and advancing through
the darkness to every village or solitary
house on its route, has now given
way for ever to the pot-wallopings of
the boiler.</p>

<p>Thus have perished multiform openings
for sublime effects, for interesting
personal communications, for revelations
of impressive faces that could
not have offered themselves amongst
the hurried and fluctuating groups of
a railway station. The gatherings of
gazers about a mail-coach had one
centre, and acknowledged only one
interest. But the crowds attending
at a railway station have as little
unity as running water, and own as
many centres as there are separate
carriages in the train.</p>

<p>How else, for example, than as a
constant watcher for the dawn, and
for the London mail that in summer
months entered about dawn into the
lawny thickets of Marlborough Forest,
couldst thou, sweet Fanny of the Bath
road, have become known to myself?
Yet Fanny, as the loveliest young
woman for face and person that perhaps
in my whole life I have beheld,
merited the station which even <i>her</i> I
could not willingly have spared; yet
(thirty-five years later) she holds in
my dreams; and though, by an accident
of fanciful caprice, she brought
along with her into those dreams a
troop of dreadful creatures, fabulous
and not fabulous, that were more
abominable to a human heart than
Fanny and the dawn were delightful.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny of the Bath road, strictly
speaking, lived at a mile's distance
from that road, but came so continually
to meet the mail, that I on
my frequent transits rarely missed
her, and naturally connected her name
with the great thoroughfare where I
saw her; I do not exactly know, but
I believe with some burthen of commissions
to be executed in Bath, her
own residence being probably the
centre to which these commissions
gathered. The mail-coachman, who
wore the royal livery, being one
amongst the privileged few,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> happened
to be Fanny's grandfather. A
good man he was, that loved his
beautiful granddaughter; and, loving
her wisely, was vigilant over her
deportment in any case where young
Oxford might happen to be concerned.
Was I then vain enough to imagine
that I myself individually could fall
within the line of his terrors? Certainly
not, as regarded any physical
pretensions that I could plead; for
Fanny (as a chance passenger from
her own neighbourhood once told me)
counted in her train a hundred and
ninety-nine professed admirers, if not
open aspirants to her favour; and
probably not one of the whole brigade
but excelled myself in personal advantages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>
<p>Ulysses even, with the unfair
advantage of his accursed bow, could
hardly have undertaken that amount
of suitors. So the danger might have
seemed slight&mdash;only that woman is
universally aristocratic: it is amongst
her nobilities of heart that she <i>is</i> so.
Now, the aristocratic distinctions in
my favour might easily with Miss
Fanny have compensated my physical
deficiencies. Did I then make
love to Fanny? Why, yes; <i>mais oui
donc</i>; as much love as one <i>can</i> make
whilst the mail is changing horses, a
process which ten years later did not
occupy above eighty seconds; but
<i>then</i>, viz. about Waterloo, it occupied
five times eighty. Now, four hundred
seconds offer a field quite ample
enough for whispering into a young
woman's ear a great deal of truth;
and (by way of parenthesis) some
trifle of falsehood. Grandpapa did
right, therefore, to watch me. And
yet, as happens too often to the grandpapas
of earth, in a contest with the
admirers of granddaughters, how
vainly would he have watched me
had I meditated any evil whispers to
Fanny! She, it is my belief, would
have protected herself against any
man's evil suggestions. But he, as
the result showed, could not have
intercepted the opportunities for such
suggestions. Yet he was still active;
he was still blooming. Blooming he
was as Fanny herself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Say, all our praises why should lords&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No, that's not the line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Say, all our roses why should girls engross?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The coachman showed rosy blossoms
on his face deeper even than his
granddaughter's,&mdash;<i>his</i> being drawn
from the ale-cask, Fanny's from
youth and innocence, and from the
fountains of the dawn. But, in spite
of his blooming face, some infirmities
he had; and one particularly, (I am
very sure, no <i>more</i> than one,) in
which he too much resembled a crocodile.
This lay in a monstrous inaptitude
for turning round. The crocodile,
I presume, owes that inaptitude to
the absurd <i>length</i> of his back; but in
our Grandpapa it arose rather from
the absurd <i>breadth</i> of his back, combined,
probably, with some growing
stiffness in his legs. Now upon this
crocodile infirmity of his I planted an
easy opportunity for tendering my
homage to Miss Fanny. In defiance
of all his honourable vigilance, no
sooner had he presented to us his
mighty Jovian back, (what a field for
displaying to mankind his royal scarlet!)
whilst inspecting professionally
the buckles, the straps, and the silver
turrets of his harness, than I raised
Miss Fanny's hand to my lips, and,
by the mixed tenderness and respectfulness
of my manner, caused her
easily to understand how happy it
would have made me to rank upon her
list as No. 10 or 12, in which case a
few casualties amongst her lovers (and
observe&mdash;they <i>hanged</i> liberally in
those days) might have promoted me
speedily to the top of the tree; as,
on the other hand, with how much
loyalty of submission I acquiesced in
her allotment, supposing that she had
seen reason to plant me in the very
rearward of her favour, as No. 199+1.
It must not be supposed that I allowed
any trace of jest, or even of
playfulness, to mingle with these expressions
of my admiration; that
would have been insulting to her,
and would have been false as regarded
my own feelings. In fact, the utter
shadowiness of our relations to each
other, even after our meetings through
seven or eight years had been very
numerous, but of necessity had been
very brief, being entirely on mail-coach
allowance&mdash;timed, in reality, by
the General Post-Office&mdash;and watched
by a crocodile belonging to the antepenultimate
generation, left it easy
for me to do a thing which few people
ever <i>can</i> have done&mdash;viz., to make
love for seven years, at the same
time to be as sincere as ever creature
was, and yet never to compromise
myself by overtures that might have
been foolish as regarded my own
interests, or misleading as regarded
hers. Most truly I loved this beautiful
and ingenuous girl; and had it
not been for the Bath and Bristol
mail, heaven only knows what might
have come of it. People talk of being
over head and ears in love&mdash;now, the
mail was the cause that I sank only
over ears in love, which, you know,
still left a trifle of brain to overlook
the whole conduct of the affair. I
have mentioned the case at all for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
sake of a dreadful result from it in
after years of dreaming. But it seems,
<i>ex abundanti</i>, to yield this moral&mdash;viz.
that as, in England, the idiot and the
half-wit are held to be under the guardianship
of Chancery, so the man making
love, who is often but a variety of the
same imbecile class, ought to be made
a ward of the General Post-Office,
whose severe course of <i>timing</i> and
periodical interruption might intercept
many a foolish declaration, such
as lays a solid foundation for fifty
years' repentance.</p>

<p>Ah, reader! when I look back upon
those days, it seems to me that all
things change or perish. Even thunder
and lightning, it pains me to say,
are not the thunder and lightning
which I seem to remember about the
time of Waterloo. Roses, I fear, are
degenerating, and, without a Red revolution,
must come to the dust. The
Fannies of our island&mdash;though this I
say with reluctance&mdash;are not improving;
and the Bath road is notoriously
superannuated. Mr Waterton tells
me that the crocodile does <i>not</i> change&mdash;that
a cayman, in fact, or an alligator,
is just as good for riding upon
as he was in the time of the Pharaohs.
<i>That</i> may be; but the reason is, that
the crocodile does not live fast&mdash;he is
a slow coach. I believe it is generally
understood amongst naturalists, that
the crocodile is a blockhead. It is my
own impression that the Pharaohs were
also blockheads. Now, as the Pharaohs
and the crocodile domineered over
Egyptian society, this accounts for a
singular mistake that prevailed on the
Nile. The crocodile made the ridiculous
blunder of supposing man to be
meant chiefly for his own eating.
Man, taking a different view of the
subject, naturally met that mistake by
another; he viewed the crocodile as a
thing sometimes to worship, but always
to run away from. And this continued
until Mr Waterton changed the relations
between the animals. The mode
of escaping from the reptile he showed
to be, not by running away, but by
leaping on its back, booted and spurred.
The two animals had misunderstood
each other. The use of the crocodile
has now been cleared up&mdash;it is to be
ridden; and the use of man is, that he
may improve the health of the crocodile
by riding him a fox-hunting before
breakfast. And it is pretty certain that
any crocodile, who has been regularly
hunted through the season, and is
master of the weight he carries, will
take a six-barred gate now as well as
ever he would have done in the infancy
of the Pyramids.</p>

<p>Perhaps, therefore, the crocodile
does <i>not</i> change, but all things else <i>do</i>:
even the shadow of the Pyramids grows
less. And often the restoration in vision
of Fanny and the Bath road, makes
me too pathetically sensible of that
truth. Out of the darkness, if I happen
to call up the image of Fanny from
thirty-five years back, arises suddenly
a rose in June; or, if I think for an
instant of the rose in June, up rises
the heavenly face of Fanny. One after
the other, like the antiphonies in a
choral service, rises Fanny and the rose
in June, then back again the rose in
June and Fanny. Then come both
together, as in a chorus; roses and
Fannies, Fannies and roses, without
end&mdash;thick as blossoms in paradise.
Then comes a venerable crocodile, in a
royal livery of scarlet and gold, or in
a coat with sixteen capes; and the
crocodile is driving four-in-hand
from the box of the Bath mail.
And suddenly we upon the mail
are pulled up by a mighty dial, sculptured
with the hours, and with the
dreadful legend of <small>TOO LATE</small>. Then
all at once we are arrived in Marlborough
forest, amongst the lovely
households<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of the roe-deer: these retire
into the dewy thickets; the thickets
are rich with roses; the roses call up
(as ever) the sweet countenance of
Fanny, who, being the granddaughter
of a crocodile, awakens a dreadful
host of wild semi-legendary animals&mdash;griffins,
dragons, basilisks, sphinxes&mdash;till
at length the whole vision of
fighting images crowds into one towering,
armorial shield, a vast emblazonry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>of human charities and human loveliness
that have perished, but quartered
heraldically with unutterable horrors
of monstrous and demoniac natures;
whilst over all rises, as a surmounting
crest, one fair female hand, with the
fore-finger pointing, in sweet, sorrowful
admonition, upwards to heaven,
and having power (which, without experience,
I never could have believed)
to awaken the pathos that kills in the
very bosom of the horrors that madden
the grief that gnaws at the heart, together
with the monstrous creations
of darkness that shock the belief, and
make dizzy the reason of man. This
is the peculiarity that I wish the reader
to notice, as having first been made
known to me for a possibility by this
early vision of Fanny on the Bath
road. The peculiarity consisted in the
confluence of two different keys, though
apparently repelling each other, into
the music and governing principles of
the same dream; horror, such as possesses
the maniac, and yet, by momentary
transitions, grief, such as may be
supposed to possess the dying mother
when leaving her infant children to
the mercies of the cruel. Usually,
and perhaps always, in an unshaken
nervous system, these two modes of
misery exclude each other&mdash;here first
they met in horrid reconciliation.
There was also a separate peculiarity
in the quality of the horror. This was
afterwards developed into far more revolting
complexities of misery and
incomprehensible darkness; and perhaps
I am wrong in ascribing any
value as a <i>causative</i> agency to this
particular case on the Bath road&mdash;possibly
it furnished merely an <i>occasion</i>
that accidentally introduced a
mode of horrors certain, at any rate,
to have grown up, with or without the
Bath road, from more advanced stages
of the nervous derangement. Yet, as
the cubs of tigers or leopards, when
domesticated, have been observed to
suffer a sudden development of their
latent ferocity under too eager an appeal
to their playfulness&mdash;the gaieties
of sport in <i>them</i> being too closely connected
with the fiery brightness of
their murderous instincts&mdash;so I have
remarked that the caprices, the gay
arabesques, and the lovely floral luxuriations
of dreams, betray a shocking
tendency to pass into finer maniacal
splendours. That gaiety, for instance,
(for such at first it was,) in the dreaming
faculty, by which one principal
point of resemblance to a crocodile in
the mail-coachman was soon made to
clothe him with the form of a crocodile,
and yet was blended with accessory
circumstances derived from his <i>human</i>
functions, passed rapidly into a further
development, no longer gay or
playful, but terrific, the most terrific
that besieges dreams, viz.&mdash;the horrid
inoculation upon each other of incompatible
natures. This horror has always
been secretly felt by man; it
was felt even under pagan forms of
religion, which offered a very feeble,
and also a very limited gamut for
giving expression to the human capacities
of sublimity or of horror. We
read it in the fearful composition of
the sphinx. The dragon, again, is the
snake inoculated upon the scorpion.
The basilisk unites the mysterious
malice of the evil eye, unintentional
on the part of the unhappy agent,
with the intentional venom of some
other malignant natures. But these
horrid complexities of evil agency are
but <i>objectively</i> horrid; they inflict the
horror suitable to their compound nature;
but there is no insinuation that
they <i>feel</i> that horror. Heraldry is
so full of these fantastic creatures,
that, in some zoologies, we find a
separate chapter or a supplement dedicated
to what is denominated heraldic
zoology. And why not? For
these hideous creatures, however
visionary,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> have a real traditionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>ground in medieval belief&mdash;sincere and
partly reasonable, though adulterating
with mendacity, blundering, credulity,
and intense superstition. But the
dream-horror which I speak of is far
more frightful. The dreamer finds
housed within himself&mdash;occupying, as
it were, some separate chamber in his
brain&mdash;holding, perhaps, from that
station a secret and detestable commerce
with his own heart&mdash;some horrid
alien nature. What if it were his own
nature repeated,&mdash;still, if the duality
were distinctly perceptible, even <i>that</i>&mdash;even
this mere numerical double of
his own consciousness&mdash;might be a
curse too mighty to be sustained.
But how, if the alien nature contradicts
his own, fights with it, perplexes,
and confounds it? How, again, if
not one alien nature, but two, but
three, but four, but five, are introduced
within what once he thought the
inviolable sanctuary of himself? These,
however, are horrors from the kingdoms
of anarchy and darkness, which,
by their very intensity, challenge the
sanctity of concealment, and gloomily
retire from exposition. Yet it was
necessary to mention them, because
the first introduction to such appearances
(whether causal, or merely
casual) lay in the heraldic monsters,
which monsters were themselves introduced
(though playfully) by the transfigured
coachman of the Bath mail.</p>


<h3>GOING DOWN WITH VICTORY.</h3>

<p>But the grandest chapter of our experience,
within the whole mail-coach
service, was on those occasions when
we went down from London with the
news of victory. A period of about
ten years stretched from Trafalgar to
Waterloo: the second and third years
of which period (1806 and 1807) were
comparatively sterile; but the rest,
from 1805 to 1815 inclusively, furnished
a long succession of victories;
the least of which, in a contest of that
portentous nature, had an inappreciable
value of position&mdash;partly for its
absolute interference with the plans
of our enemy, but still more from its
keeping alive in central Europe the
sense of a deep-seated vulnerability
in France. Even to tease the coasts
of our enemy, to mortify them by
continual blockades, to insult them
by capturing if it were but a baubling
schooner under the eyes of their arrogant
armies, repeated from time to
time a sullen proclamation of power
lodged in a quarter to which the hopes
of Christendom turned in secret. How
much more loudly must this proclamation
have spoken in the audacity<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
of having bearded the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of their
troops, and having beaten them in
pitched battles! Five years of life it
was worth paying down for the privilege
of an outside place on a mail-coach,
when carrying down the first
tidings of any such event. And it is
to be noted that, from our insular
situation, and the multitude of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>frigates disposable for the rapid transmission
of intelligence, rarely did any
unauthorised rumour steal away a
prelibation from the aroma of the regular
despatches. The government official
news was generally the first news.</p>

<p>From eight <small>P.M.</small> to fifteen or twenty
minutes later, imagine the mails assembled
on parade in Lombard Street,
where, at that time, was seated the
General Post-Office. In what exact
strength we mustered I do not remember;
but, from the length of each
separate <i>attelage</i>, we filled the street,
though a long one, and though we
were drawn up in double file. On <i>any</i>
night the spectacle was beautiful.
The absolute perfection of all the
appointments about the carriages and
the harness, and the magnificence of
the horses, were what might first have
fixed the attention. Every carriage,
on every morning in the year, was
taken down to an inspector for examination&mdash;wheels,
axles, linchpins,
pole, glasses, &amp;c., were all critically
probed and tested. Every part of
every carriage had been cleaned,
every horse had been groomed, with
as much rigour as if they belonged to
a private gentleman; and that part
of the spectacle offered itself always.
But the night before us is a night of
victory; and behold! to the ordinary
display, what a heart-shaking addition!&mdash;horses,
men, carriages&mdash;all are
dressed in laurels and flowers, oak
leaves and ribbons. The guards, who
are his Majesty's servants, and the
coachmen, who are within the privilege
of the Post-Office, wear the royal
liveries of course; and as it is summer
(for all the <i>land</i> victories were
won in summer,) they wear, on this
fine evening, these liveries exposed to
view, without any covering of upper
coats. Such a costume, and the elaborate
arrangement of the laurels in
their hats, dilated their hearts, by giving
to them openly an <i>official</i> connection
with the great news, in which
already they have the general interest
of patriotism. That great national
sentiment surmounts and quells all
sense of ordinary distinctions. Those
passengers who happen to be gentlemen
are now hardly to be distinguished
as such except by dress. The
usual reserve of their manner in speaking
to the attendants has on this night
melted away. One heart, one pride,
one glory, connects every man by the
transcendent bond of his English
blood. The spectators, who are numerous
beyond precedent, express
their sympathy with these fervent
feelings by continual hurrahs. Every
moment are shouted aloud by the
Post-Office servants the great ancestral
names of cities known to history
through, a thousand years,&mdash;Lincoln,
Winchester, Portsmouth, Gloucester,
Oxford, Bristol, Manchester, York,
Newcastle, Edinburgh, Perth, Glasgow&mdash;expressing
the grandeur of the
empire by the antiquity of its towns,
and the grandeur of the mail establishment
by the diffusive radiation of
its separate missions. Every moment
you hear the thunder of lids locked
down upon the mail-bags. That
sound to each individual mail is the
signal for drawing off, which process
is the finest part of the entire spectacle.
Then come the horses into
play;&mdash;horses! can these be horses
that (unless powerfully reined in)
would bound off with the action and
gestures of leopards? What stir!&mdash;what
sea-like ferment!&mdash;what a thundering
of wheels, what a trampling of
horses!&mdash;what farewell cheers&mdash;what
redoubling peals of brotherly congratulation,
connecting the name of the
particular mail&mdash;"Liverpool for
ever!"&mdash;with the name of the particular
victory&mdash;"Badajoz for ever!"
or "Salamanca for ever!" The half-slumbering
consciousness that, all
night long and all the next day&mdash;perhaps
for even a longer period&mdash;many
of these mails, like fire racing along
a train of gunpowder, will be kindling
at every instant new successions of
burning joy, has an obscure effect of
multiplying the victory itself, by multiplying
to the imagination into infinity
the stages of its progressive
diffusion. A fiery arrow seems to be
let loose, which from that moment
is destined to travel, almost without
intermission, westwards for three
hundred<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> miles&mdash;northwards for six
hundred; and the sympathy of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>Lombard Street friends at parting is
exalted a hundredfold by a sort of
visionary sympathy with the approaching
sympathies, yet unborn,
which we were going to evoke.</p>

<p>Liberated from the embarrassments
of the city, and issuing into the broad
uncrowded avenues of the northern
suburbs, we begin to enter upon our
natural pace of ten miles an hour. In
the broad light of the summer evening,
the sun perhaps only just at the
point of setting, we are seen from
every storey of every house. Heads
of every age crowd to the windows&mdash;young
and old understand the language
of our victorious symbols&mdash;and
rolling volleys of sympathising cheers
run along behind and before our course.
The beggar, rearing himself against
the wall, forgets his lameness&mdash;real or
assumed&mdash;thinks not of his whining
trade, but stands erect, with bold
exulting smiles, as we pass him. The
victory has healed him, and says&mdash;Be
thou whole! Women and children,
from garrets alike and cellars, look
down or look up with loving eyes upon
our gay ribbons and our martial laurels&mdash;sometimes
kiss their hands,
sometimes hang out, as signals of
affection, pocket handkerchiefs, aprons,
dusters, anything that lies ready to
their hands. On the London side of
Barnet, to which we draw near within
a few minutes after nine, observe
that private carriage which is approaching
us. The weather being so
warm, the glasses are all down; and
one may read, as on the stage of a
theatre, everything that goes on within
the carriage. It contains three ladies,
one likely to be "mama," and two of
seventeen or eighteen, who are probably
her daughters. What lovely animation,
what beautiful unpremeditated
pantomime, explaining to us every
syllable that passes, in these ingenuous
girls! By the sudden start and
raising of the hands, on first discovering
our laurelled equipage&mdash;by the
sudden movement and appeal to the
elder lady from both of them&mdash;and by
the heightened colour on their animated
countenances, we can almost
hear them saying&mdash;"See, see! Look
at their laurels. Oh, mama! there
has been a great battle in Spain; and
it has been a great victory." In a
moment we are on the point of passing
them. We passengers&mdash;I on the
box, and the two on the roof behind
me&mdash;raise our hats, the coachman
makes his professional salute with the
whip; the guard even, though punctilious
on the matter of his dignity as
an officer under the crown, touches his
hat. The ladies move to us, in return,
with a winning graciousness of
gesture: all smile on each side in a
way that nobody could misunderstand,
and that nothing short of a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>national sympathy could so instantaneously
prompt. Will these ladies say
that we are nothing to <i>them</i>? Oh, no;
they will not say <i>that</i>. They cannot
deny&mdash;they do not deny&mdash;that for this
night they are our sisters: gentle or
simple, scholar or illiterate servant,
for twelve hours to come&mdash;we on the
outside have the honour to be their
brothers. Those poor women again,
who stop to gaze upon us with delight
at the entrance of Barnet, and seem
by their air of weariness to be returning
from labour&mdash;do you mean to say
that they are washerwomen and charwomen?
Oh, my poor friend, you are
quite mistaken; they are nothing of
the kind. I assure you, they stand in
a higher rank: for this one night they
feel themselves by birthright to be
daughters of England, and answer to
no humbler title.</p>

<p>Every joy, however, even rapturous
joy&mdash;such is the sad law of earth&mdash;may
carry with it grief, or fear of grief,
to some. Three miles beyond Barnet,
we see approaching us another private
carriage, nearly repeating the circumstances
of the former case. Here also
the glasses are all down&mdash;here also is
an elderly lady seated; but the two
amiable daughters are missing; for
the single young person, sitting by
the lady's side, seems to be an attendant&mdash;so
I judge from her dress,
and her air of respectful reserve.
The lady is in mourning; and her
countenance expresses sorrow. At
first she does not look up; so that
I believe she is not aware of
our approach, until she bears the
measured beating of our horses' hoofs.
Then she raises her eyes to settle them
painfully on our triumphal equipage.
Our decorations explain the case to
her at once; but she beholds them
with apparent anxiety, or even with
terror. Sometime before this, I, finding
it difficult to hit a flying mark,
when embarrassed by the coachman's
person and reins intervening, had
given to the guard a <i>Courier</i> evening
paper, containing the gazette, for the
next carriage that might pass. Accordingly
he tossed it in so folded that
the huge capitals expressing some
such legend as&mdash;<small>GLORIOUS VICTORY</small>,
might catch the eye at once. To see
the paper, however, at all, interpreted
as it was by our ensigns of triumph,
explained everything; and, if the
guard were right in thinking the lady
to have received it with a gesture of
horror, it could not be doubtful that
she had suffered some deep personal
affliction in connexion with this
Spanish war.</p>

<p>Here now was the case of one who,
having formerly suffered, might, erroneously
perhaps, be distressing herself
with anticipations of another
similar suffering. That same night,
and hardly three hours later, occurred
the reverse case. A poor woman, who
too probably would find herself, in a
day or two, to have suffered the
heaviest of afflictions by the battle,
blindly allowed herself to express an
exultation so unmeasured in the news,
and its details, as gave to her the appearance
which amongst Celtic Highlanders
is called <i>fey</i>. This was at
some little town, I forget what, where
we happened to change horses near
midnight. Some fair or wake had
kept the people up out of their beds.
We saw many lights moving about as
we drew near; and perhaps the most
impressive scene on our route was
our reception at this place. The flashing
of torches and the beautiful radiance
of blue lights (technically Bengal
lights) upon the heads of our
horses; the fine effect of such a showery
and ghostly illumination falling upon
flowers and glittering laurels, whilst
all around the massy darkness seemed
to invest us with walls of impenetrable
blackness, together with the prodigious
enthusiasm of the people, composed a
picture at once scenical and affecting.
As we staid for three or four minutes,
I alighted. And immediately from a
dismantled stall in the street, where
perhaps she had been presiding at
some part of the evening, advanced
eagerly a middle-aged woman. The
sight of my newspaper it was that
had drawn her attention upon myself.
The victory which we were carrying
down to the provinces on <i>this</i> occasion
was the imperfect one of Talavera.
I told her the main outline of
the battle. But her agitation, though
not the agitation of fear, but of exultation
rather, and enthusiasm, had
been so conspicuous when listening,
and when first applying for information,
that I could not but ask her if
she had not some relation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
Peninsular army. Oh! yes: her only
son was there. In what regiment?
He was a trooper in the 23d Dragoons.
My heart sank within me as she made
that answer. This sublime regiment,
which an Englishman should never
mention without raising his hat to
their memory, had made the most
memorable and effective charge recorded
in military annals. They
leaped their horses&mdash;<i>over</i> a trench,
where they could <i>into</i> it, and with the
result of death or mutilation when they
could <i>not</i>. What proportion cleared the
trench is nowhere stated. Those who
<i>did</i>, closed up and went down upon
the enemy with such divinity of fervour&mdash;(I
use the word <i>divinity</i> by design:
the inspiration of God must
have prompted this movement to
those whom even then he was calling
to his presence)&mdash;that two results followed.
As regarded the enemy, this
23d Dragoons, not, I believe, originally
350 strong, paralysed a French
column, 6000 strong, then ascending
the hill, and fixed the gaze of the
whole French army. As regarded
themselves, the 23d were supposed at
first to have been all but annihilated;
but eventually, I believe, not so many
as one in four survived. And this, then,
was the regiment&mdash;a regiment already
for some hours known to myself and
all London as stretched, by a large
majority, upon one bloody aceldama&mdash;in
which the young trooper served
whose mother was now talking with
myself in a spirit of such hopeful enthusiasm.
Did I tell her the truth?
Had I the heart to break up her
dream? No. I said to myself, tomorrow,
or the next day, she will hear
the worst. For this night, wherefore
should she not sleep in peace? After
to-morrow, the chances are too many
that peace will forsake her pillow.
This brief respite, let her owe this to
<i>my</i> gift and <i>my</i> forbearance. But, if
I told her not of the bloody price that
had been paid, there was no reason
for suppressing the contributions from
her son's regiment to the service and
glory of the day. For the very few
words that I had time for speaking,
I governed myself accordingly. I
showed her not the funeral banners
under which the noble regiment was
sleeping. I lifted not the overshadowing
laurels from the bloody trench
in which horse and rider lay mangled
together. But I told her how these
dear children of England, privates
and officers, had leaped their horses
over all obstacles as gaily as hunters
to the morning's chase. I told her
how they rode their horses into the
mists of death, (saying to myself, but
not saying to <i>her</i>,) and laid down
their young lives for thee, O mother
England! as willingly&mdash;poured out
their noble blood as cheerfully&mdash;as ever,
after a long day's sport, when infants,
they had rested their wearied heads
upon their mothers' knees, or had sunk
to sleep in her arms. It is singular
that she seemed to have no fears,
even after this knowledge that the
23d Dragoons had been conspicuously
engaged, for her son's safety: but so
much was she enraptured by the
knowledge that <i>his</i> regiment, and
therefore <i>he</i>, had rendered eminent
service in the trying conflict&mdash;a service
which had actually made them
the foremost topic of conversation in
London&mdash;that in the mere simplicity
of her fervent nature, she threw her
arms round my neck, and, poor woman,
kissed me.</p>

<p>Lord Braybrooke has established
a strong claim to the gratitude of the
literary world for his present elegant,
improved, and augmented edition of
the <i>Diary of Samuel Pepys</i>. The
work may now, we presume, be regarded
as complete, for there is little
chance that any future editor will
consider himself entitled to supply the
<i>lacun&aelig;</i> or omissions which still confessedly
exist. Lord Braybrooke informs
us that, after carefully re-perusing
the whole of the manuscript, he
had arrived at the conclusion, "that
a literal transcript of the Diary was
absolutely inadmissible; and he more
than hints that most of the excluded
passages have been withheld from
print on account of their strong indelicacy."
We cannot blame the noble
editor for having thus exercised his
judgment, though we could wish that
he had been a little more explicit as
to the general tenor and application
of the proscribed entries. The Diary
of Pepys is a very remarkable one,
comprehending both a history or sketch
of the times in which he lived, and an
accurate record of his own private
transactions and affairs. He chronicles
not only the faults of others, as these
were reported to him or fell under his
personal observation, but he notes his
own frailties and backslidings with a
candour, a minuteness, and even occasionally
a satisfaction, which is at
once amusing and uncommon. The
one division of his subject is a political
and social&mdash;the other a psychological
curiosity. We are naturally desirous
to hear all about Charles and his courtiers,
and not averse to the general
run of gossip regarding that train of
beautiful women whose portraits, from
the luxuriant pencil of Lely, still adorn
the walls of Hampton Court. But
not less remarkable are the quaint
confessions of the autobiographer,
whether he be recording, in conscious
pride, the items of the dinner and the
plate with which he appeased the
appetite and excited the envy of some
less prosperous guest, or junketing
with Mrs Pierce and equivocal Mrs
Knipp the actress, whilst poor Mrs
Pepys was absent on a fortnight's
visit to the country. Far are we from
excusing or even palliating the propensities
of Pepys. We have enough
before us to show that he was a sad
flirt, and a good deal of a domestic
hypocrite: all this he admits, and
even exhibits at times a certain
amount of penitence and compunction.
But we confess that we should be glad
to know from which section of the
Diary the objectionable matter has
been expunged. If from the public
part, or rather that disconnected with
the personality of Pepys, we acquiesce
without further comment in the taste
and judgment of the editor. We do
not want to have any minute details,
even though Pepys may have written
them down, of the drunken and disgraceful
exhibitions of Sir Charles
Sedley and his comrades, or even of
the private actings of the Maids (by
courtesy) of Honour. We have enough,
and more than enough, of this in the
<i>Memoirs of Grammont</i>, and no one
would wish to see augmented that
repertory of antiquated scandal.
History, and the products of the
stage as it then existed, speak quite
unequivocally as to the general demoralisation
of those unhappy times,
and it cannot serve any manner of
use to multiply or magnify instances.
But whilst we so far freely concede
the right of omission to Lord Braybrooke,
we must own that we are not
a little jealous lest, out of respect to
the individual memory of Pepys, he
should have concealed some personal
confessions, which may have been
really requisite in order to form an
accurate estimate of the man. We
cannot read the Diary without strong
suspicions that something of the kind
has taken place. Mere flirtation on
the part of her husband could hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>have driven Mrs Pepys to the desperate
extremity of heating the tongs
in the fire, and approaching the nuptial
couch therewith, obviously for no
good purpose, to the infinite dismay
of Samuel. Pepys might perhaps be
excused for a reciprocated oscillation
of the eyelid, when Mrs Knipp
winked at him from the stage; but
why, if his motives for frequenting
her company were strictly virtuous
and artistical, did he go to kiss her
in her tireing-room? why should
she have pulled his hair, when she sat
behind him in the pit? or why should
he have been sorely troubled "that
Knipp sent by Moll (an orange-woman,
whose basket was her character)
to desire to speak to me after the
play, and I promised to come; but it
was so late, and I forced to step to
Mrs Williams' lodgings with my Lord
Brouncker and her, where I did not
stay, however, for fear of her showing
me her closet, and thereby forcing me
to give her something; and it was
so late, that, for fear of my wife's
coming home before me, I was forced
to go straight home, which troubled
me"? If Pepys was really innocent
in deed, and but culpable in thought
and inclination, his escape was a
mighty narrow one, and Mrs Pepys
may well stand excused for the
strength and frequency of her suspicions.
The truth is, that Pepys, at
least in the earlier part of his life, was
a very odious specimen of the Cockney,
and would upon many occasions have
been justly punished by a sound kicking,
or an ample dose of the cudgel.
It seems to us perfectly inexplicable
how the coxcomb&mdash;who, by the way,
was a regular church-goer, and rather
zealous religionist&mdash;could have prevailed
upon himself to make such
entries as the following in his journal:
"<i>August 18, 1667.</i>&mdash;I walked towards
Whitehall, but, being wearied, turned
into St Dunstan's church, where I
heard an able sermon of the minister
of the place; and stood by a pretty,
modest maid, whom I did labour to
take by the hand; but she would not,
but got further and further from me;
and at last I could perceive her to
take pins out of her pocket to prick
me if I should touch her again, which
seeing, I did forbear, and was glad I
did spy her design. And then I fell
to gaze upon another pretty maid in
a pew close to me, and she on me;
and I did go about to take her by the
hand, which she suffered a little, and
then withdrew. So the sermon ended,
and the church broke up, and my
amours ended also." What a pity
that the first maid in question had not
been more nimble with her fingers!
The poisoned bodkin which the goblin
page shoved into the knee of Wat
Tinlinn, would have been well bestowed,
if buried to the very head, on
this occasion, in the hip of Pepys;
and charity does not forbid us from
indulging ourselves in fancy with the
startling hideousness of his howl!
No wonder that Mrs Pepys not only
made hot the tongs, but incoherently
insisted, at times, on the necessity of
a separate maintenance.</p>

<p>The great charm of the book is its
utter freedom from disguise. The
zeal of antiquaries, and the patriotic
exertions of the literary clubs, have,
of late years, put the public in possession
of various diaries, which are most
valuable, as throwing light upon the
political incidents and social manners
of the times in which the authors lived.
Thus we have the journals of honest
John Nicholl, writer to the signet in
Edinburgh, who saw the great Marquis
of Montrose go down from his
prison to the scaffold; of the shrewd
and cautious Fountainhall; of the
high-minded and accomplished Evelyn,
and many others&mdash;the manuscripts
of which had lain for years undisturbed
on the shelf or in the charter-chest.
But it cannot be said of
any one of those diaries, that it was
kept solely for the use and reference
of the writer. Some of them may not
have been intended for publication;
and it is very likely that the thoughts
of posthumous renown never crossed
the mind of the chronicler, as he set
down his daily jotting and observation.
Nevertheless those were family
documents, such as a father, if he had
no wider aim, might have bequeathed
for the information of his children.
Diaries of more modern date have,
we suspect, been kept principally with
a view to publication; or, at least,
the writers of them seem never to
have been altogether devoid of a kind
of consciousness that their lucubrations
might one day see the light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Owing to that feeling, the veil of domestic
privacy is seldom withdrawn,
and seldomer still are we treated to
a faithful record of the deeds and
thoughts of the diarist. But Pepys
framed his journal with no such intention.
He durst not, for dear life,
have submitted a single page of it to
the inspection of the wife of his bosom&mdash;had
he been as fruitful as Jacob,
no son of his would have been intrusted
with the key which could unlock
the mysterious cipher in which the
most private passages of his life were
written. No clerk was allowed to
continue it in a clear, legible hand,
when failing eyesight rendered the
task irksome or impossible to himself.
There is something of pathos in
his last entry, when the doors of the
daily confessional were just closing
for ever. "And thus ends all that I
doubt I shall ever be able to do with
my own eyes in the keeping of my
journal, I being not able to do it any
longer, having done now so long as to
undo my eyes almost every time that
I take a pen in my hand; and,
therefore, whatever comes of it, I
must forbear; and therefore resolve,
from this time forward, to have it
kept by my people in long hand, and
must be contented to set down no
more than is fit for them and all the
world to know; or, if there be anything,
I must endeavour to keep a
margin in my book open, to add now
and then a note in short-hand, with my
own hand." Perhaps it is as well that
the marginal continuation so hinted
at was withheld; for, in the process
of decanting, the wine would have
lost its flavour, and must have suffered
terribly in contrast with the
raciness of the earlier cooper.</p>

<p>The position in life which Pepys
occupied renders his Diary doubly
interesting. Had he been only a
hanger-on of the court, we might have
heard more minute and personal scandal,
conveyed through the medium of
Bab May, or Chiffinch, or other unscrupulous
satellites of a very profligate
monarch. Had he been a mere
private citizen or merchant, his knowledge
of or interest in public events
would probably have been so small,
as to assist us but little in unravelling
the intricate history of the time.
But, standing as he did between two
classes of society, then separated by a
far stronger line of demarcation
than now,&mdash;a citizen of London
by birth and connexion, by occupation
a government official, and
through instinct an intense admirer of
the great&mdash;he had access to more
sources of information, and could interpret
general opinion better, than
the professional courtier or tradesman.
Shrewd, sharp, and not very scrupulous,
he readily seized all opportunities
of making his way in the
world; and though privately a censor
of the more open vices of the great,
he never was so truly happy as when
admitted by accident to their society.
Lord Braybrooke, we think, is too
partial in his estimate of Pepys' character.
If we are to judge of him by
his own confessions, he was largely
imbued with that spirit of meanness,
arrogance, and vanity, which dramatic
writers have always seized on as
illustrative of the parvenu, but which
is never apparent in the conversation,
or discernible in the dealings, of a true
and perfect gentleman.</p>

<p>Sam does not appear to have
troubled himself much about his pedigree
until he became a person of
considerable note and substance. Indeed,
the circumstances of his immediate
extraction were not such as to
have found much favour in the eyes of
the professors of Herald's College.
His father was a respectable tailor,
and, in his own earlier years, Pepys
had carried doublets to customers, if
not actually handled the goose. The
impressions that he received in his
boyhood seem to have been indelible
through life; prosperity could not
make him insensible to the flavour of
cucumber. The sight of a new garment
invariably kindled in his mind
the aspirations of his primitive calling,
and very proud, indeed, was he when
brother Tom brought him his "jackanapes
coat with silver buttons." In
his way he was quite a Sir Piercie
Shafton, and never formed a complete
opinion of any man without due consideration
of his clothes. At the outset
of his diary we find him married,
and in rather indifferent circumstances.
He was then a clerk in some
public office connected with the Exchequer,
at a small salary. But he
was diligent in his vocation, and prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
in his habits; so that he and his
wife, and servant Jane, fared not
much worse, or perhaps rather
better, than Andrew Marvell, for we
find them living in a garret, and dining
on New Year's day on the remains
of a turkey, in the dressing
whereof Mrs Pepys unfortunately
burned her hand. A few days afterwards,
they mended their cheer at the
house of "cosen Thomas Pepys" the turner,
where the dinner "was very good;
only the venison pasty was palpable
mutton, which was not handsome."
But the advent of better banquets
was near. In the preceding autumn,
the old protector, Oliver Cromwell,
had been carried to the grave, and the
reins of government, sorely frayed
and worn, were given to the weak
hands of Richard. In truth, there
was hardly any government at all.
The military chiefs did not own the
second Cromwell as their master;
Lambert was attempting to get up a
party in his own favour; and Monk,
in command of the northern army,
was suspected of a similar design.
The bulk of the nation, in terror of
anarchy, and heartily sick of the consequences
of revolution, which, as
usual, had terminated in arbitrary
rule, longed for the restoration of
their legitimate sovereign, as the only
means of arresting further calamity;
and several of the influential officers,
not compromised by regicide, were
secretly of the same opinion. Amongst
these latter was Sir Edward Montagu,
admiral of the fleet, afterwards created
Earl of Sandwich, whose mother was
a Pepys, and with whom, accordingly,
Samuel was proud to reckon kin.
Sir Edward had been already very
kind to his young relative, and now
laid the foundation of his fortunes by
employing him as his secretary, during
the expedition which ended with the
return of Charles II. to his hereditary
dominions. Pepys, in his boyish days,
had been somewhat tainted with the
Roundhead doctrines, but he was now
as roaring a royalist as ever danced
round a bonfire; and the slight accession
of profit which accrued to him
for his share in the Restoration, gave
him an unbounded appetite for future
accumulations. He made himself
useful to Montagu, who presently
received his earldom, and through his
interest Pepys was installed in office
as clerk of the Acts of the Navy.</p>

<p>Other snug jobs followed, and
Pepys began to thrive apace. It is
possible that, if judged by the standard
of morality recognised in his
time, our friend may have been
deemed, on the whole, a tolerably
conscientious officer; but, according
to our more strict ideas, he hardly
could have piqued himself, like a
modern statesman, on the superior
purity of his palms. If not grossly
avaricious, he was decidedly fond of
money; he cast up his accounts with
great punctuality, and seems to have
thought that each additional hundred
pounds came into his possession
through a special interposition of Providence.
Now, although we know well
that there is a blessing upon honest
industry, it would appear that a good
deal of Pepys' money flowed in
through crooked channels. Bribes
and acknowledgments he received
without much compunction or hesitation,
only taking care that little evidence
should be left of the transaction.
The following extract shows
that his conscience was by no means
of stiff or inflexible material: "I
met Captain Grove, who did give me
a letter directed to myself from himself.
I discerned money to be in it,
knowing as I found it to be, the proceeds
of the place I have got him to
be&mdash;the taking up of vessels for Tangier.
But I did not open it till I came
home&mdash;not looking into it until all
the money was out, that I might say
I saw no money in the paper, if ever
I should be questioned about it.
There was a piece in gold, and &pound;4
in silver." Pepys made altogether a
good thing out of the Tangier settlement,
for which he was afterwards
secretary, as, besides such small pickings
as the above, we read of magnificent
silver flagons&mdash;"the noblest that
ever I saw all the days of my life"&mdash;presented
to him, in grateful acknowledgment
of services to come, by Gauden,
victualler of the navy. Samuel
had twinges of conscience, but the
sight of the plate was too much for
him: "Whether I shall keep them or
no," saith he, striving to cast dust in
his own eyes, "I cannot tell; for it is
to oblige me to him in the business of
the Tangier victualling, wherein I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
doubt I shall not; but glad I am to
see that I shall be sure to get something
on one side or other, have it
which will; so with a merry heart I
looked upon them, and locked them
up." The flagons, however, did the
business. Gauden was preferred;
and, from an entry in the Diary, made
about a year afterwards, we must
conclude that his profits were enormous:
"All the afternoon to my
accounts; and then find myself, to my
great joy, a great deal worth&mdash;above
&pound;4000&mdash;for which the Lord be
praised! and is principally occasioned
by my getting &pound;500 of Cocke for my
profit in his bargains of prize goods,
and from Mr Gauden's making me a
present of &pound;500 more, when I paid
him &pound;800 for Tangier. Thus ends
this year, to my great joy, in this
manner. I have raised my estate
from &pound;1300, in this year, to &pound;4400."
A pretty accretion: but made, we fear,
at the expense of the nation, by means
which hardly would have stood the
scrutiny of a court of justice. It may
be quite true that every man in office,
from the highest to the lowest, from
the chancellor to the doorkeeper, was
then doing the like; still we cannot
give Pepys the benefit of a perfect indemnity
on the score of the general
practice. Even when he tells us elsewhere,
with evident satisfaction&mdash;"This
night I received, by Will, &pound;105,
the first-fruits of my endeavours in
the late contract for victualling of
Tangier, for which God be praised!
for I can, with a safe conscience,
say that I have therein saved the
king &pound;5000 per annum, and yet got
myself a hope of &pound;300 per annum,
without the least wrong to the king"&mdash;it
is impossible to reconcile his conduct
with the strict rules of morality,
or of duty: nor, perhaps, need we do
so, seeing that Pepys makes no pretence
of being altogether immaculate.
He began by taking small fees in a
surreptitious way, and ended by
pocketing the largest without a single
twinge. It is the progress from remuneration
to guerdon, as philosophically
explained by Costard&mdash;"Guerdon!&mdash;O
sweet guerdon! better than
remuneration; eleven-pence farthing
better. Most sweet guerdon!&mdash;I will
do it, sir, in print;&mdash;guerdon&mdash;remuneration!"</p>

<p>The common proverb tells us that
money easily got is lightly expended.
In one sense Pepys formed no exception
to the common rule; for, notwithstanding
divers good resolutions, he
led rather a dissipated life for a year
or two after the Restoration, and was
in the constant habit of drinking more
wine than altogether agreed with his
constitution. This fault he strove to
amend by registering sundry vows,
which, however, were often broken;
and he was finally weaned from the
bottle by the pangs of disordered digestion.
His expenses kept pace with
his income. The "jackanapes coat,
with silver buttons," was succeeded
by a "fine one of flowered tabby vest,
and coloured camelot tunique, made
stiff with gold lace at the bands," in
which Pepys probably expected to do
great execution in the Park, or, at
any rate, to astonish Mrs Knipp; but
it proved to be so extravagantly fine,
that his friends thought it necessary
to interfere. "Povy told me of my
gold-laced sleeve in the Park yesterday,
which vexed me also, so as to
resolve never to appear in court with
them, but presently to have them
taken off, as it is fit I should, and so
called at my tailor's for that purpose."
Povy's hint might have its origin in
envy; but, on the whole, it was wise
and judicious. Also Mrs Pepys was
indulged with a fair allowance of lace,
taffeta, and such trinkets as females
affect; and both of them sat for their
portraits to Hales, having previously
been refused by Lely. Furniture and
plate of the most expensive description
were ordered; and finally, to his
intense delight, Samuel achieved the
great object of his own ambition, and
set up a carriage of his own. The
account of his first public appearance
in this vehicle is too characteristic to
be lost:&mdash;"At noon home to dinner,
and there found my wife extraordinary
fine, with her flowered
gown that she made two years
ago, now laced exceeding pretty,
and indeed was fine all over; and
mighty earnest to go, though the day
was very lowering; and she would have
me put on my fine suit, which I did.
And so anon we went alone through
the town with our new liveries of
serge, and the horses' manes and tails
tied with red ribbons, and the standards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
gilt with varnish, and all clean,
and green reins, that people did
mightily look upon us; and, the truth
is, I did not see any coach more pretty,
though more gay, than ours all the
day. But we set out, out of humour&mdash;I,
because Betty, whom I expected,
was not come to go with us; and my
wife, that I would sit on the same seat
with her, which she likes not, being so
fine; and she then expected to meet
Sheres, which we did in the Pell Mell,
and, against my will, I was forced to
take him into the coach, but was sullen
all day almost, and little complaisant;
the day being unpleasing, though the
Park full of coaches, but dusty, and
windy, and cold, and now and then a
little dribbling of rain; and, what made
it worse, there were so many hackney
coaches as spoiled the sight of the
gentlemen's; and so we had little
pleasure." The tale of Seged, Emperor
of Ethiopia, does not convey a
clearer moral. No peacock was prouder
than Samuel Pepys, as he stepped
that day, in all the luxury of gorgeous
apparel, into his coach, and
drove through the streets of London,
under the distinct impression that, for
the moment, he was the most remarked
and remarkable man in the whole
of his Majesty's dominions. Yet
there were drops of bitterness in the
cup. Betty Turner was not there to
enjoy the triumph, and Sheres, who
must needs join the party, was supposed
by Samuel to stand rather high
in the good graces of Mrs Pepys, insomuch
that he mourned not a whit
when he heard that the gallant captain
was about to set off to Tangier.
Add to this, the ungenial weather,
and the insolent display of hackney
coaches, obscuring somewhat the lustre
of his new turn-out, and detracting
from the glory of red ribbons, gilt
standards, and green reins, and we
need hardly wonder if, even in the
hour of triumph, Pepys felt that he
was mortal. It is to be hoped that,
when he returned home, he vented his
ill-humour neither upon his wife nor
his monkey, both of whom, on other
occasions, were made to suffer when
anything had gone wrong.</p>

<p>Three great national events, which
have not yet lost their interest, are
recorded in this Diary. These are the
plague, the great fire of London, and
the successful enterprise of De Ruyter
and the Dutch fleet at Chatham. The
account of the plague will be read
with much interest, especially at the
present time, when another terrible
epidemic has been raging through the
streets and lanes of the metropolis.
The progress of the plague through
Europe seems, in many respects, to
have resembled that of the cholera.
It did not burst out suddenly in one
locality, but appears to have pervaded
the Continent with a gradual and
irresistible march, sometimes lingering
in its advance, and ever and anon
breaking out with redoubled virulence.
Several years before it reached
England, the pestilence raged in
Naples, and is said to have carried off
in six months nearly 400,000 victims.
Its introduction was traced to a transport
ship, with soldiers on board,
coming from Sardinia. It reached
Amsterdam and Hamburg more than
a year before it broke out in London,
and its malignity may be judged of by
the following entry in Pepys' Diary:
"We were told to-day of a sloop, of
three or four hundred tons, where all
the men were dead of the plague, and
the sloop cast ashore at Gottenburg."
In England there had been great apprehension
of its coming, long before
the visitation; and two exceedingly
unhealthy seasons, occurring in succession,
had probably enfeebled the
constitutions of many, and rendered
them more liable to the contagion.
Pepys' note of 15th January 1662 is
as follows: "This morning Mr Berkenshaw
came again, and after he
had examined me, and taught me
something in my work, he and I went
to breakfast in my chamber upon a
collar of brawn; and after we had
eaten, asked me whether we had not
committed a fault in eating to-day;
telling me that it is a fast-day, ordered
by the parliament, to pray for more
seasonable weather; it having hitherto
been summer weather: that it is,
both as to warmth and every other
thing, just as if it wore the middle of
May or June, which do threaten a
plague, (as all men think,) to follow,
for so it was almost the last winter;
and the whole year after hath
been a very sickly time to this day."
The plague appeared in London in
December 1664, and reached its deadliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
point in August and September
of the ensuing year. The number of
those who died from it has been differently
estimated from sixty-eight to
one hundred thousand. London is
now, according to the best authorities,
about four times as populous as it was
then, so that we may easily judge of
the consternation into which its inhabitants
must have been thrown
when the pestilence was at its worst.
During the month of September 1849,
the greatest number of deaths occurring
from cholera in the metropolis, in
one day, was about four hundred and
fifty&mdash;a proportion very small when
compared with the ravages of the
plague at its most destructive season,
and yet large enough to justify great
apprehension, and to demand humiliation
and prayer for national apathy
and transgression. Yet, great as the
alarm was, when death was waving
his wings over the affrighted city, it
does not seem to have been so excessive
as we might well imagine. The
truth is, that, not withstanding intramural
interment, bad sewerage, and
infected air, the sanatory condition of
London, since it was rebuilt after the
great fire, has improved in a most remarkable
degree. Prior to that event,
the metropolis had at various times
suffered most severely from epidemics.
In 1204, when the population must have
been very small, it is recorded that
two hundred persons were buried
daily in the Charterhouse-yard. The
mortality in 1367 has been described
as terrific. In 1407, thirty thousand
persons perished of a dreadful
pestilence. There was another in
1478, which not only visited London
with much severity, but is said to
have destroyed, throughout England,
more people than fell in the wars
which had raged with little intermission
for the fifteen preceding years.
In 1485, that mysterious complaint
called the sweating sickness was very
fatal in London. Fifteen years later,
in 1500, the plague there was so
dreadful that Henry VII. and his
court were forced to remove to Calais.
The sweating sickness, described as
mortal in three hours, again scourged
England in 1517, and its ravages
were so great, that, according to
Stowe, half of the inhabitants of most
of the larger towns died, and Oxford
was almost depopulated. In 1603-4,
upwards of thirty thousand persons
died of the plague in London alone;
and in 1625 there was another great
mortality. Since the great plague of
London in 1664-5, down to our time,
no very fatal epidemic&mdash;at least none
at all comparable to those earlier
pestilences&mdash;seems to have occurred
in the metropolis, and it is therefore
natural that any extraordinary visitation
should, from its increased rarity,
occasion a much higher degree of
alarm. Of all the accounts extant of
the plague, that of Pepys appears to
be the most truthful and the least
exaggerated. He remained in London
at his post until the month of
August, when he removed to Greenwich;
and although a timorous man,
and exceedingly shy of exposing himself
to unnecessary risks, he seems on
this occasion to have behaved with
considerable fortitude. One anecdote
we cannot omit, for it tells in a
few words a deep and tearful tragedy,
and is moreover honourable to Pepys.
It occurred when the plague was at
its height. "My Lord Brouncker,
Sir J. Minnes, and I, up to the
vestry, at the desire of the justices of
the peace, in order to the doing something
for the keeping of the plague
from growing; but, Lord! to consider
the madness of people of the
town, who will, because they are forbid,
come in crowds along with the
dead corpses to see them buried; but
we agreed on some orders for the prevention
thereof. Among other stories,
one was very passionate, methought,
of a complaint brought against a man
in the town, for taking a child from
London from an infected house. Alderman
Hooker told us it was the
child of a very able citizen in Gracious
Street, a saddler, who had buried all
the rest of his children of the plague;
and himself and wife, now being
shut up in despair of escaping, did
desire only to save the life of this
little child, and so prevailed to have
it removed, stark-naked, into the
arms of a friend, who brought it, having
put it into fresh clothes, to Greenwich;
when, upon hearing the story,
we did agree it should be permitted
to be received, and kept in the town."
It is now generally admitted that
the Account of the Plague, written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
Defoe, cannot be accepted as a
genuine narrative, but must be classed
with the other fictions of that remarkable
man, whose singular power
of giving a strong impression of
reality to every one of his compositions
must always challenge the
admiration of the reader. He has
not, perhaps, aggravated the horrors
of the pestilence, for that were impossible;
but he has concentrated them
in one heap, so as to produce a more
awful picture than probably met the
eye of any single citizen of London
even at that disastrous period. Pepys,
in his account of different visits which
he was forced to make to the City
when the epidemic was at its height,
has portrayed the outward desolation,
and the inward anxiety and apprehension,
which prevailed, in more
sober, yet very striking colours: "<i>28th
August 1665.</i>&mdash;To Mr Colville the
goldsmith's, having not been for some
days in the streets; but now how few
people I see, and those looking like
people that had taken leave of the
world. To the Exchange, and there
was not fifty people upon it, and but
few more like to be, as they told me.
I think to take adieu to-day of the
London streets.... <i>30th.</i>&mdash;Abroad,
and met with Hadley, our
clerk, who, upon my asking how the
plague goes, told me it increases
much, and much in our parish; for,
says he, there died nine this week,
though I have returned but six;
which is a very ill practice, and makes
me think it is so in other places, and
therefore the plague much greater
than people take it to be. I went
forth, and walked towards Moorefields,
to see&mdash;God forgive my presumption!&mdash;whether
I could see any dead corpse
going to the grave, but, as God would
have it, did not. But, Lord! how
everybody's looks and discourse in the
street is of death, and nothing else!
and few people going up and down,
that the town is like a place deserted
and forsaken.... <i>6th Sept.</i>&mdash;To
London, to pack up more things;
and there I saw fires burning in the
street, (as it is through the whole
city,) by the lord mayor's order.
Hence by water to the Duke of Albemarle's:
all the way fires on each side
of the Thames, and strange to see, in
broad daylight, two or three burials
upon the Bankside, one at the very
heels of another: doubtless, all of the
plague, and yet at least forty or fifty
people going along with every one of
them.... <i>20th.</i>&mdash;Lord! what
a sad time it is to see no boats upon
the river; and grass grows all up and
down Whitehall Court, and nobody
but poor wretches in the streets!"
By this time the plague had become
so general, that all attempt to shut
up the infected houses was abandoned;
so that, says Pepys, "to be
sure, we do converse and meet with
people that have the plague upon
them." A little later, when the pestilence
was abating, we find this
entry: "I walked to the town; but,
Lord! how empty the streets are,
and melancholy! so many poor, sick
people in the streets, full of sores, and
so many sad stories overheard as I
walk, everybody talking of this dead,
and that man sick, and so many in
this place, and so many in that; and
they tell me that, in Westminster,
there is never a physician, and but
one apothecary, left&mdash;all being dead;
but that there are great hopes of a
great decrease this week: God send
it!" Still, without the circle of the
plague, (for it does not seem to have
penetrated beyond the immediate
environs of London,) men ate, drank,
and made merry, as though no vial
of divine wrath had been poured out
amongst them. Even Pepys, after
returning from the melancholy spectacles
of this day, seems to have
drowned his care in more than usual
jollity; and his records go far to confirm
the truthfulness of Boccaccio, in
the account which he has given of the
levity of the Florentines during the
prevalence of a like contagion.</p>

<p>The fire of London, which occurred
about the middle of the succeeding
year, not only dispelled the more
poignant memories of the plague,
but is thought to have done good
service in eradicating its remains,
which still lingered in some parts of
the city, and may perhaps have been
the means of preventing a second
outbreak of this pestilence. On the
second night the conflagration was
awful: Pepys watched it from the
river,&mdash;"So near the fire as we could
for the smoke; and all over the
Thames, with one's face in the wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
you were almost burned with a shower
of fire-drops. This is very true; so as
houses were burned by these drops
and flakes of fire&mdash;three or four, nay,
five or six houses, one from another.
When we could endure no more upon
the water, we to a little alehouse on
the Bankside, over against the Three
Cranes, and there stayed till it was
dark almost, and saw the fire grow,
and, as it grew darker, appeared more
and more; and in corners, and upon
steeples, and between churches and
houses, as far as we could see up the
hill of the City, in a most horrid,
malicious, bloody flame, not like the
fine flame of an ordinary fire. Barbary
and her husband away before us.
We stayed till, it being darkish, we
saw the fire as only one entire arch of
fire, from this to the other side of the
bridge, and in a bow up the hill for
an arch of above a mile long: it
made me weep to see it. The churches,
houses, and all on fire and flaming at
once; and a horrid noise the flames
made, and the cracking of houses at
their ruin." For five days the conflagration
raged, nor was its force spent
until the greater part of London was
laid in ashes. The terror of the calamity
was heightened by rumours industriously
propagated, though their
origin never could be traced. The fire
was said to be the result of a deep-laid
Popish plot; and that report,
though in all probability utterly without
foundation, was at a future day
the cause of shameful persecution and
bloodshed. A great alarm was raised
that the Dutch, with whom England
was then at war, and whose fleet was
actually in the Channel, had landed;
so that a kind of sullen despair and
apathy seized upon the minds of
many. It was long before London
could recover from the blow; but at
length a new city, far more substantial
and splendid than the first, arose
from the scattered ruins.</p>

<p>England was at that time contesting
the supremacy of the seas with
the States of opulent and enterprising
Holland. Amsterdam was then considered
the most wealthy capital of
Europe. The Dutch navy was powerful,
well equipped, and well manned,
and the admirals, De Ruyter and De
Witt, were esteemed second to none
living for seamanship and ability.
The struggle was not a new one. In
1652, after a desperate engagement
with Blake, Van Tromp, the renowned
commander of Holland, had sailed in
triumph through the Channel, with a
broom at his masthead, to denote that
he had swept the English from the
seas. That premature boast was
afterwards terribly avenged. Three
times, in three successive months, did
these foes, worthy of each other, encounter
on the open seas, and yet
victory declared for neither. Four
other battles were fought, which England
has added to her proud list of
naval triumphs; but most assuredly
the decisive palm was not won until,
on the 31st July 1653, gallant Van
Tromp fell in the heat of action. A
braver man never trod the quarterdeck,
and Holland may well be proud
of such a hero. For a time the States
succumbed to the stern genius of
Cromwell; nor did the struggle commence
anew until after the Restoration
of Charles. The first engagement
was glorious for England. The Duke
of York, afterwards James II., commanded
in person: he encountered the
Dutch fleet off Harwich, and defeated
it after a stubborn engagement.
Eighteen of their finest vessels were
taken, and the ship of the admiral
(Opdam) blown into the air. Mr
Macaulay, in his late published <i>History
of England</i>, has not deigned even
to notice this engagement&mdash;a remarkable
omission, the reason of which it
is foreign to our purpose to inquire.
This much we may be allowed to say,
that no historian who intends to form
an accurate estimate of the character
of James II., or to compile a complete
register of his deeds, can justly accomplish
his task without giving that
unfortunate monarch due credit for
his conduct and intrepidity, in one
of the most important and successful
naval actions which stands recorded in
our annals. The same year (1665) is
memorable for another victory, when
the Earl of Sandwich captured fourteen
of the enemy's ships. Prince
Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle
were less successful in the engagement
which commenced on 1st June
1666. The fight lasted four days,
with no decisive result, but considerable
loss on either side. The next
battle, fought at the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
Thames, ended in favour of England;
the Dutch lost four-and-twenty men-of-war,
and four of their admirals,
and four thousand officers and seamen,
fell. When we take into consideration
the state of the navy during
the earlier part of the reign of Charles,
it is absolutely astonishing that England
was able not only to cope with
the Dutch on equal terms, but ultimately
to subdue them. We learn
from Pepys the particulars of a fact
long generally known, that in no department
of the state were there
greater corruptions, abuses, and frauds
practised than in that of the Admiralty.
The pay both of officers and
men was constantly in arrear, insomuch
that some of them were reduced
to absolute starvation whilst
considerable sums were due to them.
Stores were embezzled and plundered
almost without inquiry. The fleets
were often wretchedly commanded,
for there was not then, as there is
now, any restriction between the services;
and new-made captains from
the circle of the court, who never in
their lives had been at sea, were frequently
put over the heads of veterans
who from boyhood had dwelt
upon the ocean. There was scarcely
any discipline in the navy; impressment
was harshly and illegally practised,
and after each engagement the
sailors deserted by hundreds. So bad
did matters at length become, that,
towards the close of the year 1666,
the fleet was in actual mutiny, and
the naval arm of England paralysed.
The subsequent reform of the navy is
mainly attributable to the firmness
and determination of the Duke of
York, who, being a far better man of
business than his indolent and selfish
brother, applied himself resolutely to
the task. The most important suggestions
and rules for remedying
grievances, and securing future efficiency,
were made and drawn out by
Pepys, who showed himself, in this
respect, a most able officer of the
crown, and who, in consequence, acquired
an ascendency in navy affairs,
which lie never lost until the Revolution
deprived him of a master who
thoroughly understood his value. But,
before any steps were taken towards
this most necessary reform, her daring
adversaries aimed at the capital of
England a blow which narrowly failed
of success.</p>

<p>The seamen, as we have said, being
in a state of mutiny arising from
sheer wanton mismanagement, it became
apparent that no active naval
operations could be undertaken in the
course of the following year. All this
was well known to the Dutch, who
determined to avail themselves of the
opportunity. During the spring of
1667, the whole British coast, as far
north as the firth of Forth, was molested
by the Dutch cruisers, insomuch
that great inconvenience was
felt in London from the total stoppage
of the coal trade. In the month
of June, De Ruyter, being by that
time fully prepared and equipped,
sailed boldly into the Thames, without
encountering a vestige of opposition.
It is not too much to say, that
the plague and fire combined, had not
struck the citizens of London with so
much alarm as did this hostile demonstration.
All the former naval
triumphs of England seemed to have
gone for nothing, for here was invasion
brought to the very doors of the
capital. The supremacy of the seas
was not now in dispute: it was the
occupancy of the great British river,
the highway of the national commerce.
Strange were the thoughts,
that haunted the minds of men whilst
that mighty armament was hovering
on our shores: it seemed a new
Armada, with no gallant Drake to
oppose it. "We had good company
at our table," wrote Pepys, upon the
3d of June; "among others, my good
Mr Evelyn, with whom, after dinner,
I stepped aside, and talked upon the
present posture of our affairs, which
is, that the Dutch are known to be
abroad with eighty sail of ships of
war, and twenty fireships; and the
French come into the Channel, with
twenty sail of men-of-war, and five
fireships, while we have not a ship
at sea to do them any hurt with; but
are calling in all we can, while our
ambassadors are treating at Breda;
and the Dutch look upon them as
come to beg peace, and use them accordingly:
and all this through the
negligence of our prince, who had
power, if he would, to master all these
with the money and men that he hath
had the command of, and may now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
have if he would mind his business.
But, for aught we see, the kingdom is
likely to be lost, as well as the reputation
of it, for ever; notwithstanding
so much reputation got and preserved
by a rebel that went before
him." All this was true. Had <i>he</i>
been alive&mdash;he whose senseless clay
had six years before been exhumed
and dishonoured at Tyburn&mdash;England
would not then have been submitting
to so unexampled a degradation.
Traitor and renegade as he was,
Cromwell loved his country well.
Self-ambition might be his first
motive, but he was keenly alive to
the glory of England, and had made
her name a word of fear and terror
among the nations. He was no vulgar
demagogue, like those of our dogmatic
time. Unlawfully as he had usurped
the functions of a sovereign, Britain
suffered nothing in foreign estimation
while her interests were committed to
his charge. What wonder if, at such
a crisis, Pepys and others could not
help reverting to the memory of the
strong man whose bones were lying
beneath the public gallows, whilst the
restored king was squandering among
his harlots that treasure which, if
rightfully applied, might have swept
the enemies of England from the
seas?</p>

<p>On the 8th of June, the Dutch fleet
appeared off Harwich. Two days
afterwards they ascended the river,
took Sheerness, and, breaking an
enormous chain which had been drawn
across the Medway for defence, penetrated
as far as Upnor Castle, where,
in spite of all resistance, they made
prize of several vessels, and burned
three men-of-war. By some shameful
mismanagement the English ships
had been left too far down the river,
notwithstanding orders from the Admiralty
to have them removed: they
were, besides, only half manned; and
on this occasion the English sailors
did not exhibit their wonted readiness
to fight. It was even reported to
Pepys, by a gentleman who was present,
"that he himself did hear many
Englishmen, on board the Dutch ships,
speaking to one another in English;
and that they did cry and say, We
did heretofore fight for tickets, now we
fight for dollars! and did ask how
such and such a one did, and would
commend themselves to them&mdash;which
is a sad consideration." Reinforcements
arrived from Portsmouth; but
instead of working, they "do come to
the office this morning to demand the
payment of their tickets; for otherwise
they would, they said, do no more
work; and are, as I understand from
everybody who has to do with them,
the most debauched, damning, swearing
rogues that ever were in the navy&mdash;just
like their profane commander."
It seemed, at one time, more than probable
that the Dutch would attack
the city: had they made the attempt,
it is not likely, so great was the panic,
that they would have been encountered
by effectual opposition; but De
Ruyter was apprehensive of pushing
his advantage too far, and contented
himself with destroying such shipping
as he found in the river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, great was the explosion
of public wrath, both against the Court
and the Admiralty officials. Crowds
of people congregated in Westminster,
loudly clamouring for a parliament.
The windows of the Lord Chancellor's
house were broken, and a gibbet
erected before his gate. "People do
cry out in the streets of their being
bought and sold; and both they, and
everybody that do come to me, do
tell me that people make nothing of
talking treason in the streets openly;
as, that they are bought and sold, and
governed by Papists, and that we are
betrayed by people about the king,
and shall be delivered up to the
French, and I know not what." Poor
Pepys expected nothing else than an
immediate attack upon his office, in
which, by some miraculous circumstance,
there happened to be at the
moment a considerable sum of public
money. His situation rendered him
peculiarly obnoxious to abuse; and
at one time it was currently reported
that he was summarily ordered to the
Tower. These things cost him no
little anxiety; but what distracted
him most was, the agonising thought
that the whole of his private savings
and fortune, which he had by him in
specie, might, in a single moment, be
swept away and dissipated for ever.
If the seamen who were mutinous for
pay should chance to hear of the funds
in hand, and take it into their heads
to storm the office, there was little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
probability of them drawing nice distinctions
between public and private
property: and, in that case, money,
flagons, and all would find their way
to Wapping. Also, there might be a
chance of a reckoning in any event;
"for," said he, "the truth is, I do
fear so much that the whole kingdom
is undone, that I do this night resolve
to study with my father and wife what
to do with the little I have in money
by me, for I give up all the rest that
I have in the king's hands, for Tangier,
for lost. So God help us! and
God knows what disorders we may
fall into, and whether any violence
on this office, or perhaps some severity
on our persons, as being
reckoned by the silly people, or perhaps
may, by policy of state, be
thought fit to be condemned by the
king and Duke of York, and so put to
trouble; though, God knows! I have
in my own person done my full duty,
I am sure." So, in the very midst of
the confusion, Samuel, like a wise
man, set about regulating his own affairs.
He was lucky enough to get
&pound;400 paid him, to account of his salary,
and he despatched his father and
wife to Cambridgeshire, with &pound;1300
in gold in their night-bag. Next day
Mr Gibson, one of his clerks, followed
them with another 1000 pieces, "under
colour of an express to Sir Jeremy
Smith." The two grand silver flagons
went to Kate Joyce's, where it is to
be presumed they would be tolerably
safe. Pepys, moreover, provided
himself a girdle, "by which, with
some trouble, I do carry about me
&pound;300 of gold about my body, that I
may not be without something in case
I should be surprised; for I think, in
any nation but ours, people that appear&mdash;for
we are not indeed so&mdash;so
faulty as we would have their throats
cut." Still he had &pound;200 in silver by
him, which was not convertible into
gold, there having been, as usual on
such occasions, a sharp run upon the
more portable metal. His ideas as to
secreting this sum would not have
displeased Vespasian, but he seems to
have been deterred from that experiment
by the obvious difficulty of recovering
the silver at the moment of
need. These dispositions made, Pepys
obviously felt himself more comfortable,
and manfully resolved to abide
the chances of assault, imprisonment,
or impeachment.</p>

<p>None of those calamities befell him.
After the navy of Holland had disappeared
from the waters of the Thames,
an inquiry, of rather a strict and rigorous
nature, as to the causes of the
late disaster, was instituted; but,
where the blame was so widely
spread, and retort so easy, it was difficult
to fix upon any particular victim
as a propitiation for the official
sins; and Pepys, who really understood
his business, made a gallant and
successful defence, not only for himself,
but for his associates. We need
not, however, enter into that matter,
more especially as we hope that the
reader feels sufficient interest in Pepys
and his fortunes, to be curious to
know what became of his money; nor
is the history of its disposal and recovery
the least amusing portion of
this narrative.</p>

<p>Mr Peter Pett, commissioner of the
navy, who was principally blamable
for the loss of the ships at Chatham,
had been actually sent to the Tower;
and our friend Pepys, being summoned
to attend the council, had an awful
misgiving that the same fate was in
store for him. He escaped, however;
"but my fear was such, at my going
in, of the success of the day, that I
did think fit to give J. Hater, whom I
took with me to wait the event, my
closet key, and directions where to
find &pound;500 and more in silver and
gold, and my tallies, to remove in
case of any misfortune to me. Home,
and after being there a little, my wife
came, and two of her fellow-travellers
with her, with whom we drank&mdash;a
couple of merchant-like men, I think,
but have friends in our country. They
being gone, my wife did give me so bad
an account of her and my father's method,
in burying of our gold, that made
me mad; and she herself is not pleased
with it&mdash;she believing that my sister
knows of it. My father and she did
it on Sunday, when they were gone to
church, in open daylight, in the midst
of the garden, where, for aught they
knew, many eyes might see them,
which put me into trouble, and I presently
cast about how to have it back
again, to secure it here, the times
being a little better now."</p>

<p>The autumn was well advanced before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Pepys could obtain leave to go
down into the country, whither at
length he proceeded, not to shoot partridges
or pheasants, but to disinter his
buried treasure. We doubt whether
ever resurrectionist felt himself in such
a quandary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My father and I with a dark-lantern,
being now night, into the garden with
my wife, and there went about our great
work to dig up my gold. But, Lord!
what a tosse I was for some time in, that
they could not justly tell where it was;
that I began hastily to sweat, and be
angry that they could not agree better
upon the place, and at last to fear that it
was gone: but by-and-by, poking with a
spit, we found it, and then began with a
spudd to lift up the ground. But, good
God! to see how sillily they did it, not half
a foot under ground, and in the sight of the
world from a hundred places, if anybody
by accident were near hand, and within
sight of a neighbour's window: only my
father says that he saw them all gone to
church before he began the work, when he
laid the money. But I was out of my
wits almost, and the more for that, upon
my lifting up the earth with the spudd, I
did discern that I had scattered the pieces
of gold round about the ground among
the grass and loose earth; and taking up
the iron headpieces wherever they were
put, I perceived the earth was got among
the gold, and wet, so that the bags were
all rotten, and all the notes, that I could
not tell what in the world to say to it, not
knowing how to judge what was wanting,
or what had been lost by Gibson in his
coming down; which, all put together,
did make me mad; and at last I was fixed
to take up the headpieces, dirt and all,
and as many of the scattered pieces as I
could with the dirt discern by candle-light,
and carry them into my brother's chamber,
and there lock them up till I had eat
a little supper; and then, all people going
to bed, W. Hewer and I did all alone,
with several pails of water and besoms, at
last wash the dirt off the pieces, and parted
the pieces and the dirt, and then began
to tell them by a note which I had of the
value of the whole, in my pocket; and do
find that there was short above a hundred
pieces; which did make me mad; and
considering that the neighbour's house
was so near that we could not possibly
speak one to another in the garden at that
place where the gold lay&mdash;especially my
father being deaf&mdash;but they must know
what we had been doing, I feared that
they might in the night come and gather
some pieces and prevent us the next morning;
so W. Hewer and I out again about
midnight, for it was now grown so late,
and there by candle-light did make shift
to gather forty-five pieces more. And so
in, and to cleanse them; and by this time
it was past two in the morning; and so to
bed, with my mind pretty quiet to think
that I have recovered so many, I lay in
the trundle-bed, the girl being gone to bed
to my wife, and there lay in some disquiet
all night, telling of the clock till it was
daylight."</p></div>

<p>Then ensued a scene of washing for
gold, the study of which may be useful
to any intending emigrant to California.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And then W. Hewer and I, with pails
and a sieve, did lock ourselves into the
garden, and there gather all the earth
about the place into pails, and then sift
those pails in one of the summer-houses,
just as they do for diamonds in other
parts of the world; and there, to our
great content, did by nine o'clock make
the last night's forty-five up seventy-nine:
so that we are come to about twenty or
thirty of what the true number should be;
and perhaps within less; and of them I
may reasonably think that Mr Gibson
might lose some: so that I am pretty
well satisfied that my loss is not great,
and do bless God that all is so well.
So do leave my father to make a second
examination of the dirt; and my mind at
rest on it, being but an accident: and so
gives me some kind of content to remember
how painful it is sometimes to keep
money, as well as to get it, and how
doubtful I was to keep it all night, and
how to secure it in London: so got all
my gold put up in bags."</p></div>

<p>And then did Samuel Pepys return
to London rejoicing, not one whit the
worse for all his care and anxiety, yet
still incubating on his treasure, which
he had prudently stowed away beneath
him, and, says he, "my work every
quarter of an hour was to look to see
whether all was well; and I did ride
in great fear all the day."</p>

<p>We have already hinted that
Pepys was by no means a Hector in
valour. The sight of a suspicious
bumpkin armed with a cudgel, on the
road, always gave him qualms of apprehension;
and in the night-season
his dreams were commonly of robbery
and murder. For many nights after
the great fire, he started from sleep
under the conviction that his premises
were in a bright flame: the creaking
of a door after midnight threw him
into a cold perspiration; and a reported
noise on the leads nearly drove him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
past his judgment. He thus reports
his sensations on the occurrence of the
latter phenomenon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Knowing that I have a great sum of
money in the house, this puts me into a
most mighty affright, that for more than
two hours, I could not almost tell what
to do or say, but feared this night, and
remembered that this morning I saw a
woman and two men stand suspiciously
in the entry, in the dark; I calling to
them, they made me only this answer,
the woman saying that the men only
come to see her; but who she was, I
cannot tell. The truth is, my house is
mighty dangerous, having so many ways
to be come to; and at my windows, over
the stairs, to see who goes up and down;
but if I escape to-night, I will remedy it.
God preserve us this night safe! So, at
almost two o'clock I home to my house,
and, in great fear, to bed, thinking every
running of a mouse really a thief; and so
to sleep, very brokenly, all night long,
and found all safe in the morning."</p></div>

<p>All of us have, doubtless, on occasion,
been wakened from slumber by
a hollow bellowing, as if an ox had,
somehow or other, fallen half way
down the chimney. Once, in a
remote country district, we were
roused from our dreams by a hideous
flapping of wings in the same locality,
and certainly did, for a moment, conjecture
that the foul fiend was flying
away with our portmanteau. The
first of these untimeous sounds usually
proceeds from a gentleman of Ethiopian
complexion, who is perched somewhere
among the chimney-pots; the
latter we discovered to arise from the
involuntary struggles of a goose, who
had been cruelly compelled to assist
in the dislodgement of the soot. Some
degree of tremor on such occasions is
admissible without reproach, but
surely old Trapbois himself could
hardly have behaved worse than
Pepys upon the following alarm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Waked about seven o'clock this
morning, with a noise I supposed I heard
near our chamber, of knocking, which
by-and-by increased; and I, now awake,
could distinguish it better. I then
waked my wife, and both of us wondered
at it, and lay so a great while, while
that increased, and at last heard it plainer,
knocking, as it were breaking down a
window for people to get out; and then
removing of stools and chairs; and
plainly, by-and-by, going up and down
our stairs. We lay, both of us, afraid;
yet I would have rose, but my wife would
not let me. Besides, I could not do it
without making noise; and we did both
conclude that thieves were in the house,
but wondered what our people did, whom
we thought either killed, or afraid as we
were. Thus we lay till the clock struck
eight, and high day. At last, I removed
my gown and slippers safely to the other
side of the bed, over my wife; and there
safely rose, and put on my gown and
breeches, and then, with a firebrand in
my hand, safely opened the door, and saw
nor heard anything. Then, with fear, I
confess, went to the maid's chamber door,
and all quiet and safe. Called Jane up,
and went down safely, and opened my
chamber door, where all well. Then
more freely about, and to the kitchen,
where the cookmaid up, and all safe. So
up again, and when Jane came, and we
demanded whether she heard no noise,
she said "Yes, but was afraid," but rose
with the other maid and found nothing;
but heard a noise in the great stack of
chimneys that goes from Sir J. Minnes's
through our house; and so we sent, and
their chimneys have been swept this
morning, and the noise was that, and
nothing else. <i>It is one of the most extraordinary
accidents in my life</i>, and
gives ground to think of Don Quixote's
adventures, how people may be surprised;
and the more from an accident last night,
that our young gibb-cat did leap down
our stairs, from top to bottom, at two
leaps, and frighted us, that we could not
tell whether it was the cat or a spirit,
and do sometimes think this morning that
the house might be haunted."</p></div>

<p>Had our space admitted of it, we
should have been glad to copy a few
of the anecdotes narrated by Pepys
regarding the court of King Charles.
These are not always to be depended
upon as correct, for Pepys usually received
them at second hand, and put
them down immediately without further
inquiry. We all know, from experience,
what exaggeration prevails
in the promulgation of gossip, and
how difficult it is at any time to ascertain
the real merits of a story. The
raw material of a scandalous anecdote
passes first into the hands of a skilful
manufacturer, who knows how to give
it due colour and fit proportion; and
when, after undergoing this process,
it is presented to the public, it would
puzzle any of the parties concerned to
reconcile it with the actual facts. In
a court like that of Charles, there is
always mixed up with the profligacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
a considerable deal of wit. Such men
as Sedley, Rochester, Etherege, and
Killigrew, were privileged characters,
and never scrupled to lay on the
varnish, if by so doing they could
heighten the effect. Neither the
station, nor the manners, nor, indeed,
the tastes of Pepys, qualified him to
mix with such society, and therefore
he can only retail to us the articles
which came adulterated to his hand.
It is rash in any historian to trust
implicitly to memoirs. They may,
indeed, give an accurate general picture,
but they cannot be depended on
for particulars: for example, we entertain
a strong suspicion that one-half
at least of the personal anecdotes
related by Count Anthony Hamilton
are, if not absolutely false, at least
most grossly exaggerated. We shall
allude merely to one notable instance
of this kind of misrepresentation which
occurs in Pepys. Frances, more commonly
known as La Belle Stewart, a
lady of the noble house of Blantyre, was
beloved by Charles II., with probably
as much infusion of the purer passion
as could be felt by so sated a voluptuary.
So strong was his admiration,
that it was currently believed that the
fair Stewart, failing Katherine, had an
excellent chance of being elevated to
the throne; and it is quite well known
that her virtue was as spotless as her
beauty was unrivalled. In spite of
the opposition of the king, she married
Charles, Duke of Lennox and Richmond;
and her resolute and spirited
conduct on that occasion, under very
trying circumstances, was much and
deservedly extolled. And yet we
find in the earlier pages of Pepys
most scandalous anecdotes to her discredit.
In the second volume there is
an account of a mock marriage between
her and Lady Castlemaine, in
which the latter personated the bridegroom,
making way, when the company
had retired, for the entry of her
royal paramour. On several other
occasions Pepys alludes to her as the
notorious mistress of the king, and it
was only after her marriage that he
appears to have been undeceived. His
informant on this occasion was the
honourable Evelyn, and it may not
displease our readers to hear his vindication
of the lady&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He told me," says Pepys, "the whole
story of Mrs Stewart's going away from
Court, he knowing her well, and believes
her, up to her leaving the Court,
to be as virtuous as any woman in
the world: and told me, from a lord that
she told it to but yesterday, with her own
mouth, and a sober man, that when the
Duke of Richmond did make love to her
she did ask the King, and he did the like
also, and that the King did not deny it:
and told this lord that she was come to
that pass as to have resolved to have
married any gentleman of &pound;1500 a year
that would have had her in honour; for
it was come to that pass, that she would
not longer continue at Court without yielding
herself to the King, whom she had so
long kept off, though he had liberty more
than any other had, or he ought to have,
as to dalliance. She told this lord that
she had reflected upon the occasion she
had given the world to think her a bad
woman, and that she had no way but to
marry and leave the Court, rather in this
way of discontent than otherwise, that
the world might see that she sought not
anything but her honour; and that she
will never come to live at Court more
than when she comes to town to kiss the
Queen her mistress's hand: and hopes,
though she hath little reason to hope, she
can please her lord so as to reclaim him,
that they may yet live comfortably in the
country on his estate."</p></div>

<p>"A worthy woman," added Evelyn,
"and in that hath done as great an
act of honour as ever was done by
woman." The fact is, that it was next
thing to impossible for any lady to
preserve her reputation at the court
of King Charles. Those who handle
pitch cannot hope to escape defilement;
and daily association with the
Duchess of Cleveland, and other
acknowledged mistresses of the king,
was not the best mode of impressing
the public with the idea of a woman's
virtue. Frances Stuart, a poor unprotected
girl, did, we verily believe,
pass through as severe an ordeal as
well can be imagined: the cruel accusations
which were raised up against
her, were no more than the penalty
of her position; but no stain of disgrace
remains on the memory of her,
whose fair and faultless form was
selected as the fittest model for the
effigy of the Genius of Britain.</p>

<p>In a small way, Pepys had some
intercourse with the ladies of the
court, though it must be confessed
that his acquaintances were rather of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
the lower sphere. He was a staunch
admirer of that splendid spitfire, Lady
Castlemaine, whose portrait he greatly
coveted. "It is," quoth he, "a most
blessed picture, and one I must have
a copy of." Mary Davis seems to
have been no favourite of his, principally
because she was an object of
especial detestation to the monopolising
Castlemaine. He styled her an
"impertinent slut," and, one night at
the theatre, "it vexed me to see Moll
Davis, in the box over the king's, and
my Lady Castlemaine's, look down
upon the king, and he up to her; and
so did my Lady Castlemaine once, to
see who it was; but when she saw
Moll Davis, she looked like fire, which
troubled me." Why it should have
troubled Pepys, we cannot perfectly
comprehend. With Nell Gwynne,
Samuel was upon exceedingly easy
terms; and no wonder, for she and
Knipp belonged to the same company.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To the King's house: and there, going
in, met with Knipp, and she took us
up into the tireing-rooms; and to the
women's shift, where Nell was dressing
herself, and was all unready, and as very
pretty, prettier than I thought. And into
the scene-room, and there sat down, and
she gave us fruit; and here I read the
questions to Knipp, while she answered
me, through all her part of "Flora Figarys,"
which was acted to-day. But,
Lord! to see how they were both painted
would make a man mad, and did make
me loathe them; and what base company
of men comes among them, and how
lewdly they talk! and how poor the men
are in clothes, and yet what a show they
make upon the stage by candle-light, is
very observable. But to see how Nell
cursed, for having so few people in the
pit, was pretty; the other house carrying
away all the people at the new play, and
is said, now-a-days, to have generally
most company, as being better players.
By-and-by into the pit, and there saw the
play, which is pretty good."</p></div>

<p>We dare wager a trifle that Mrs
Pepys died in total ignorance of her
husband having been behind the
scenes. Probably Nelly's style of
conversation would have found less
favour in her eyes. True, she had
been introduced to Nelly on a previous
occasion; but the little lady
seems then to have been on her good
behaviour, and had not made herself
notorious with Lord Buckhurst, and
Sir Charles Sedley, as was the case
when Sam assisted at her toilet. Here
again we find that arch-intriguer,
Knipp, countermining the domestic
peace of poor innocent Mrs Pepys.
"Thence to the King's house, and
there saw <i>The Humorous Lieutenant</i>,
a silly play, I think; only the Spirit
in it that grows very tall, and then
sinks again to nothing, having two
heads breeding upon one; and then
Knipp's singing did please us. Here,
in a box above, we spied Mrs Pierce;
and, going out, they called us, and
brought to us Nelly, a most pretty
woman, who acted the great part of
C&oelig;lia to-day very fine, and did it
pretty well. I kissed her, and so did
my wife; and a mighty pretty soul
she is. We also saw Mrs Bell,
which is my little Roman-nose black
girl, that is mighty pretty: she is
usually called Betty. Knipp made us
stay in a box and see the dancing&mdash;preparatory
to to-morrow, for <i>The
Goblins</i>, a play of Suckling's, not acted
these twenty-five years&mdash;which
was pretty; and so away thence,
pleased with this sight also, and specially
kissing of Nell."</p>

<p>We have searched these volumes
with some curiosity for entries which
might throw any light on the history
and character of the Duke of Monmouth.
Of late he has been exalted
to the rank of a champion of the Protestant
cause, and figures in party
chronicles rather as a martyr than a
rebel. Now, although there is no
doubt that he was privy to the designs
of Sydney and Russell, the object of
his joining that faction still remains a
mystery to be explained. We can
understand the spirit that animated
the Whig Lords and Republican plotters,
in attempting to subvert the
power of the crown, which they
deemed exorbitant and dangerous
to the liberties of the subject.
The personal character of the men
was quite reconcilable with the motives
they professed, and the principles
they avowed. But that Monmouth&mdash;the
gay, fickle, licentious,
and pampered Monmouth&mdash;had any
thought beyond his own aggrandisement,
in committing such an act of
monstrous ingratitude as rebellion
against his indulgent father, seems to
us an hypothesis unsubstantiated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
even a shadow of proof. We do not
here allude to his second treason,
which brought him to the scaffold&mdash;his
motives on that occasion are sufficiently
clear: he never was a favourite
with his uncle; he aimed at the crown
through a false assertion of his legitimacy;
and the knaves and fools who
were his counsellors made use of the
cry of Protestantism merely as a cover
to their designs. Monmouth's first
treason was undoubtedly his blackest
crime: for, had he been the rightful
heir of Britain, he could not have experienced
at the hands of Charles
more ample honour and affection. It
is, therefore, valuable to know what
position he occupied during the earlier
period of his life.</p>

<p>The following are some of Pepys'
entries, which we think are historically
valuable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"31st Dec. 1662.&mdash;The Duke of Monmouth
is in so great splendour at court,
and so dandled by the King, that some
doubt that, if the King should have no
child by the Queen, which there is yet no
appearance of, whether he would not be
acknowledged as a lawful son; and that
there will be a difference between the
Duke of York and him, which God prevent!...
8th Feb. 1663.&mdash;The little
Duke of Monmouth, it seems, is ordered
to take place of all Dukes, and so do follow
Prince Rupert now, before the Duke
of Buckingham, or any else....
27th April.&mdash;The Queen, which I did not
know, it seems was at Windsor, at the
late St George's feast there; and the
Duke of Monmouth dancing with her,
with his hat in his hand, the King came
in and kissed him, and made him put on
his hat, which everybody took notice of....
4th May.&mdash;I to the garden
with my Lord Sandwich, after we had sat
an hour at the Tangier committee, and
after talking largely of his own businesses,
we began to talk how matters are at
court: and though he did not fully tell me
any such thing, yet I do suspect that all
is not kind between the King and the
Duke, (York) and that the King's fondness
to the little Duke do occasion it; and it
may be that there is some fear of his
being made heir to the crown....
22d Feb. 1664.&mdash;He (Charles) loves not
the Queen at all, but is rather sullen to
her; and she, by all reports, incapable of
children. He is so fond of the Duke of
Monmouth that everybody admires it;
and he says that the Duke hath said,
that he would be the death of any man
that says the King was not married to his
mother.... 11th September
1667.&mdash;Here came Mr Moore, and sat
and conversed with me of public matters,
the sum of which is, that he has no doubt
there is more at the bottom than the removal
of the Chancellor; that is, he do
verily believe that the King do resolve to
declare the Duke of Monmouth legitimate,
and that we shall soon see it. This I do
not think the Duke of York will endure
without blows."</p></div>

<p>These are but a few of Pepys' notes
relative to this subject, and we think
there is much significancy in them.
The fondness of Charles for Monmouth
was, to say the least of it,
extravagant and injudicious. He
promoted him to the highest grade of
the nobility; he procured for him a
match with one of the wealthiest
heiresses in Britain; and he allowed
and encouraged him to assume outward
marks of distinction which had
always been considered the prerogative
of Princes of the blood royal.
In the words of Dryden&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His favour leaves me nothing to require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevents my wishes and outruns desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What more can I expect while David lives?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but his kingly diadem he gives."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such unprecedented honours heaped
upon the eldest of the bastards of
Charles must necessarily have been
extremely annoying to the Duke of
York, and were ill-calculated to conciliate
his favour, in the event of
his succeeding to the crown. They
certainly were enough to give much
weight to the rumour long current in
the nation, that Charles contemplated
the step of declaring Monmouth legitimate,
and of course they excited in
the mind of the youth aspirations of
the most dangerous nature. At no
period of his career did the son of
Lucy Walters display qualities which
can fairly entitle him to our esteem.
As a husband, he was false and heartless;
as a son, he was undutiful and
treacherous. Pepys always speaks of
him disparagingly, as a dissipated,
profligate young man; and he is borne
out in this testimony by the shameful
outrage committed on the person of
Sir John Coventry, at his direct instigation.
Again he says, "16th
December 1666&mdash;Lord Brouncker tells
me, that he do not believe the Duke
of York will go to sea again, though
there are many about the king that
would be glad of any occasion to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
him out of the world, he standing in
their ways: and seemed to mean the
Duke of Monmouth, who spends his
time the most viciously and idle of
any man, nor will be fit for anything;
yet he speaks as if it were not impossible
but the king would own him
for his son, and that there was marriage
between his mother and him."
This was a strange champion to put
forward in the cause of liberty and
religion.</p>

<p>We now take our leave of these
volumes, the perusal of which has
afforded us some pleasant hours.
Every one must regret that the health
of Pepys compelled him to abandon
his daily task so early; for by far the
most interesting period of the reign of
Charles remains unillustrated by his
pen. Had his Diary been continued
down to the Revolution, with the
same spirit which characterises the
extant portion, it would have been
one of the most useful historical records
in the English language. Pepys,
beyond the immediate sphere of his
own office, was no partisan. He
never throws an unnecessary mantle
over the faults even of his friends and
patrons. No man was more alive to
the criminal conduct of Charles, and
his shameful neglect of public duty.
He has his quips and girds at the
Duke of York, though he entertained
a high, and, we think, a just opinion
of the natural abilities of that prince:
and while he gives him due credit for
a sincere desire to reform abuses in
that public department which was
under his superintendence, he shows
himself by no means blind to his vices,
and besetting obstinacy. Even the
Earl of Sandwich, to whom he was so
much indebted, does not escape. On
one occasion, Pepys took upon himself
to perform the dangerous office
of a Mentor to that high-spirited
nobleman, and it is to the credit
of both parties that no breach of
friendship ensued. Good advice was
an article which Samuel was ever
ready to volunteer, and his natural
shrewdness rendered his councils really
valuable. But, like many other people,
he was not always so ready
with his purse. Considering that he
owed everything he possessed in the
world to the earl, we think he might
have opened his coffers, at such a
pinch as the following, without any
Israelitish contemplation of security.
"After dinner comes Mr Moore, and
he and I alone awhile, he telling me
my Lord Sandwich's credit was like
to be undone, if the bill of &pound;200 my
Lord Hinchingbroke wrote to me about
be not paid to-morrow, and that, if I
do not help them about it, they have
no way but to let it be protested. So,
finding that Creed had supplied them
with &pound;150 in their straits, and that
this was no bigger sum, I am very
willing to serve my lord, though not
in this kind; but yet I will endeavour
to get this done for them, and the
rather because of some plate that was
lodged the other day with me, by my
lady's order, which may be in part
security for my money. This do trouble
me; but yet it is good luck that
the sum is no bigger." We cannot
agree with Lord Braybrooke that
Pepys was a liberal man, even to his
own relations. We do not go the
length of saying that he was deficient
in family duties, but it seems to us
that he might have selected a fitter
gift for his father than his old shoes;
and surely, when his sister Paulina
came to stay with him, there was no
necessity for insisting that she should
eat with the maids, and consider herself
on the footing of a servant.
Whatever Pepys may have been in
after life, he portrays himself in his
Diary as a singularly selfish man; nor
is that character at all inconsistent
with the shrewd, but sensual, and
somewhat coarse expression of his
features in the frontispiece. Yet it
is impossible to read the Diary without
liking him, with all his faults.
There was, to be sure, a great deal of
clay in his composition, but also many
sparkles of valuable metal; and perhaps
these are seen the better from
the roughness of the material in which
they are embedded. This at least
must be conceded, that these volumes
are unique in literature, and so they
will probably remain.</p>

"Action is the first great requisite of a colonist, (that is, a pastoral or agricultural

pursuits. I have known men of an active, energetic, contented disposition,
with a good flow of animal spirits, who had been bred in luxury and refinement,
succeed better than men bred as farmers, who were always hankering after bread
and beer, and market ordinaries of Old England.... To be dreaming when
you should be looking after your cattle, is a terrible drawback.... There are
certain persons who, too lazy and too extravagant to succeed in Europe, sail for
Australia under the idea that fortunes are to be made there by a sort of legerdemain,
spend or lose their capital in a very short space of time, and return to England to
abuse the place, the people, and everything connected with colonisation."&mdash;<i>Sidney's

"I will instance the case of one person who had been a farmer in England, and
emigrated with about &pound;2000 about seven years since. On his arrival, he found that
the prices of sheep had fallen from about 30s. to 5s. or 6s. per head, and he bought
some well-bred flocks at these prices. He was fortunate in obtaining a good and
extensive <i>run</i>, and he devoted the whole of his time to improving his flocks, and
encouraged his shepherds by rewards; so that, in about four years, his original number
of sheep had increased from 2500 (which cost him &pound;700) to 7000; and the
breed and wool were also so much improved that he could obtain &pound;1 per head for
2000 fat sheep, and 15s. per head for the other 5000, and this at a time when the
general price of sheep was from 10s. to 16s. This alone increased his original capital,
invested in sheep, from &pound;700 to &pound;5700. The profits from the wool paid the whole of
his expenses and wages for his men."</p></div>

of the planets from the central body round which they revolve, and their absolute
magnitudes, densities, times of rotation, eccentricities and inclinations of orbit and of
axis. We find Mars, though more distant from the sun than either the earth or
Venus, inferior to them in magnitude; Saturn is less than Jupiter, and yet much
larger than Uranus. The zone of the telescopic planets, which are so inconsiderable
in point of volume, viewed in the series of distances commencing from the sun, comes
next before Jupiter, the greatest in size of all the planetary bodies. Remarkable as
is the small density of all the colossal planets which are farthest from the sun, yet
neither in this respect can we recognise any regular succession. Uranus appears to
be denser than Saturn, and (though the inner group of planets differ but little from
each other in this particular) we find both Venus and Mars less dense than the earth,
which is situated between them. The time of rotation increases, on the whole, with
increasing solar distance, but yet it is greater in Mars than in the earth, and in
Saturn than in Jupiter." After other remarks of the same character, he adds, "The
planetary system, in its relation of absolute magnitude, relative position of the axis,
density, time of rotation, and different degrees of eccentricity of the orbits, has, to
our apprehension, nothing more of natural necessity than the relative distribution of
land and water on the surface of our globe, the configuration of continents, or the
elevation of mountain chains. No general law, in these respects, is discoverable
either in the regions of space or in the irregularities of the crust of the earth."</p></div>

of right to the mail coachmen as their professional dress. But that was an
error. To the guard it <i>did</i> belong as a matter of course, and was essential as an
official warrant, and a means of instant identification for his person, in the discharge
of his important public duties. But the coachman, and especially if his place in the
series did not connect him immediately with London and the General Post-Office,
obtained the scarlet coat only as an honorary distinction after long or special service.</p></div>

deer, but by separate families, parents, and children; which feature of approximation
to the sanctity of human hearths, added to their comparatively miniature and
graceful proportions, conciliate to them an interest of a peculiarly tender character,
if less dignified by the grandeurs of savage and forest life.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> "<i>However visionary.</i>"&mdash;But <i>are</i> they always visionary? The unicorn, the kraken,
the sea-serpent, are all, perhaps, zoological facts. The unicorn, for instance, so far
from being a lie, is rather <i>too</i> true; for, simply as a <i>monokeras</i>, he is found in the
Himalaya, in Africa, and elsewhere, rather too often for the peace of what in Scotland
would be called the <i>intending</i> traveller. That which really <i>is</i> a lie in the account of
the unicorn&mdash;viz., his legendary rivalship with the lion&mdash;which lie may God preserve,
in preserving the mighty imperial shield that embalms it&mdash;cannot be more destructive
to the zoological pretensions of the unicorn, than are to the same pretensions
in the lion our many popular crazes about his goodness and magnanimity, or the old
fancy (adopted by Spenser, and noticed by so many among our elder poets) of his
graciousness to maiden innocence. The wretch is the basest and most cowardly
among the forest tribes; nor has the sublime courage of the English bull-dog ever
been so memorably exhibited as in his hopeless fight at Warwick with the cowardly
and cruel lion called Wallace. Another of the traditional creatures, still doubtful,
is the mermaid, upon which Southey once remarked to me, that, if it had been differently
named, (as, suppose, a mer-ape) nobody would have questioned its existence
any more than that of sea-cows, sea-lions, &amp;c. The mermaid has been discredited by her
human name and her legendary human habits. If she would not coquette so much
with melancholy sailors, and brush her hair so assiduously upon solitary rocks,
she would be carried on our books for as honest a reality, as decent a female, as
many that are assessed to the poor-rates.</p></div>

would not have been so popular in London, at the period of her present Majesty's
coronation, or in Manchester, on occasion of his visit to that town, if they had been
aware of the insolence with which he spoke of us in notes written at intervals from
the field of Waterloo. As though it had been mere felony in our army to look a
French one in the face, he said more than once&mdash;"Here are the English&mdash;we have
them: they are caught <i>en flagrant delit</i>." Yet no man should have known us better;
no man had drunk deeper from the cup of humiliation than Soult had in the north of
Portugal, during his flight from an English army, and subsequently at Albuera, in
the bloodiest of recorded battles.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> "<i>Three hundred.</i>" Of necessity this scale of measurement, to an American, if he
happens to be a thoughtless man, must sound ludicrous. Accordingly, I remember a
case in which an American writer indulges himself in the luxury of a little lying,
by ascribing to an Englishman a pompous account of the Thames, constructed entirely
upon American ideas of grandeur, and concluding in something like these
terms:&mdash;"And, sir, arriving at London, this mighty father of rivers attains a breadth
of at least two furlongs, having, in its winding course, traversed the astonishing distance
of 170 miles." And this the candid American thinks it fair to contrast with the
scale of the Mississippi. Now, it is hardly worth while to answer a pure falsehood
gravely, else one might say that no Englishman out of Bedlam ever thought of looking
in an island for the rivers of a continent; nor, consequently, could have thought
of looking for the peculiar grandeur of the Thames in the length of its course, or in
the extent of soil which it drains: yet, if he <i>had</i> been so absurd, the American might
have recollected that a river, not to be compared with the Thames even as to volume
of water&mdash;viz. the Tiber&mdash;has contrived to make itself heard of in this world for
twenty-five centuries to an extent not reached, nor likely to be reached very soon, by
any river, however corpulent, of his own land. The glory of the Thames is measured
by the density of the population to which it ministers, by the commerce which it supports,
by the grandeur of the empire in which, though far from the largest, it is the
most influential stream. Upon some such scale, and not by a transfer of Columbian
standards, is the course of our English mails to be valued. The American may fancy
the effect of his own valuations to our English ears, by supposing the case of a Siberian
glorifying his country in these terms:&mdash;"Those rascals, sir, in France and England,
cannot march half a mile in any direction without finding a house where food
can be had and lodging: whereas, such is the noble desolation of our magnificent
country, that in many a direction for a thousand miles, I will engage a dog shall not
find shelter from a snow-storm, nor a wren find an apology for breakfast."</p></div>
